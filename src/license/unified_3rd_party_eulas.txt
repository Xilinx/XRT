Part One: Overview.

The following information applies to certain items of third-party technology that are included along with certain Xilinx software tools.

Licensee's use of the GNU compilers (including associated libraries and utilities) may cause Licensee's software application (or board-support package) to be governed by certain third-party "open source" license agreements, as further described below.  Licensee can avoid this result by using alternative compilers, libraries, and utilities of its own choosing in lieu of the GNU compilers (and associated libraries and utilities). 
 
Note:  Licensee is solely responsible for checking the header files and other accompanying source files of all software applications created from the use of the GNU compliers (and associated libraries and utilities) because such header and/or source files may contain or describe various copyright notices and license terms and conditions governing such files, which vary from case to case based on Licensee's usage and are beyond the control of Xilinx.  This summary and the license information provided below is for reference purposes and is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all copyright notices or third-party license terms and conditions applicable to Xilinx software tools.  Licensee is solely responsible for complying with the terms and conditions imposed by third parties as applicable to the Licensee's software applications created from the use of the GNU compilers (and associated libraries and utilities).

The text of the GNU General Public License, Version 2, a copy of which is made available below in Part Four of this document, subject to the FreeRTOS GPL Exception Text below, applies to the above-listed file(s):
The FreeRTOS GPL Exception Text:

Any FreeRTOS source code, whether modified or in it's original release form,
or whether in whole or in part, can only be distributed by you under the terms
of the GNU General Public License plus this exception. An independent module is
a module which is not derived from or based on FreeRTOS.

Clause 1:

Linking FreeRTOS statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
combined work based on FreeRTOS. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
General Public License cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holder of FreeRTOS gives you permission
to link FreeRTOS with independent modules that communicate with FreeRTOS
solely through the FreeRTOS API interface, regardless of the license terms of
these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting combined
work under terms of your choice, provided that

  + Every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a written statement that
  details to the recipient the version of FreeRTOS used and an offer by yourself
  to provide the FreeRTOS source code (including any modifications you may have
  made) should the recipient request it.

  + The combined work is not itself an RTOS, scheduler, kernel or related product.

  + The independent modules add significant and primary functionality to FreeRTOS
  and do not merely extend the existing functionality already present in FreeRTOS.

Clause 2:

FreeRTOS may not be used for any competitive or comparative purpose, including the
publication of any form of run time or compile time metric, without the express
permission of Real Time Engineers Ltd. (this is the norm within the industry and
is intended to ensure information accuracy).


Commercial Licensing

 
OpenRTOSTM is a commercially licensed version of FreeRTOS. The OpenRTOS license does not contain any references to the GPL.
SAFERTOSTM is a derivative version of FreeRTOS that has been analyzed, documented and tested to meet the stringent requirements of the IEC 61508 safety standard.

The text of the GNU General Public License, Version 2, a copy of which is made available below in Part Four of this document, subject to the FreeRTOS GPL Exception Text below, applies to the above-listed file(s):
The FreeRTOS GPL Exception Text:

Any FreeRTOS source code, whether modified or in it's original release form,
or whether in whole or in part, can only be distributed by you under the terms
of the GNU General Public License plus this exception. An independent module is
a module which is not derived from or based on FreeRTOS.

Clause 1:

Linking FreeRTOS statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
combined work based on FreeRTOS. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
General Public License cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holder of FreeRTOS gives you permission
to link FreeRTOS with independent modules that communicate with FreeRTOS
solely through the FreeRTOS API interface, regardless of the license terms of
these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting combined
work under terms of your choice, provided that

  + Every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a written statement that
  details to the recipient the version of FreeRTOS used and an offer by yourself
  to provide the FreeRTOS source code (including any modifications you may have
  made) should the recipient request it.

  + The combined work is not itself an RTOS, scheduler, kernel or related product.

  + The independent modules add significant and primary functionality to FreeRTOS
  and do not merely extend the existing functionality already present in FreeRTOS.

Clause 2:

FreeRTOS may not be used for any competitive or comparative purpose, including the
publication of any form of run time or compile time metric, without the express
permission of Real Time Engineers Ltd. (this is the norm within the industry and
is intended to ensure information accuracy).


Certain files:

For the avoidance of any doubt refer to the comment included at the top
of each source and header file for license and copyright information.

This is a list of files for which Real Time Engineers Ltd are not the
copyright owner and are NOT COVERED BY THE GPL.


1) Various header files provided by silicon manufacturers and tool vendors
   that define processor specific memory addresses and utility macros.
   Permission has been granted by the various copyright holders for these
   files to be included in the FreeRTOS download.  Users must ensure license
   conditions are adhered to for any use other than compilation of the
   FreeRTOS demo applications.

2) The uIP TCP/IP stack the copyright of which is held by Adam Dunkels.
   Users must ensure the open source license conditions stated at the top
   of each uIP source file is understood and adhered to.

3) The lwIP TCP/IP stack the copyright of which is held by the Swedish
   Institute of Computer Science.  Users must ensure the open source license
   conditions stated at the top  of each lwIP source file is understood and
   adhered to.

4) Various peripheral driver source files and binaries provided by silicon
   manufacturers and tool vendors.  Permission has been granted by the
   various copyright holders for these files to be included in the FreeRTOS
   download.  Users must ensure license conditions are adhered to for any

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition

This version: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition

Copyright (c) 1984, Sun Microsystems, Inc. These routines interface XDRSTREAMS to a
tcp/ip connection. There is a record marking layer between the xdr stream and
the tcp transport level. A record is composed on one or more record fragments. A
record fragment is a thirty-two bit header followed by n bytes of data, where n
is contained in the header. The header is represented as a htonl(u_long). Thegh
order bit encodes whether or not the fragment is the last fragment of the record
(1 > fragment is last, 0 > more fragments to follow. The other 31 bits encode
the byte length of the fragment. /

License (MPL) version 1.1.  Some files are available under more
liberal terms, but we believe that in all cases, each file may be used

Please see each file in the implementation for copyright and licensing
information, (in the opening comment of each file).

[*] The implementation of cairo is contained entirely within the "src"
directory of the cairo source distribution. There are other components
of the cairo source distribution (such as the "test", "util", and "perf")
that are auxiliary to the library itself. None of the source code in these
directories contributes to a build of the cairo library itself, (libcairo.so
or cairo.dll or similar).

THE ACCOMPANYING SOFTWARE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT"). PLEASE REVIEW
THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.  ANY USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR
DISTRIBUTION  OF  THE  PROGRAM  CONSTITUTES  ACCEPTANCE  OF  THIS
AGREEMENT.   IF YOU ARE AGREEING TO THIS LICENSE ON BEHALF  OF  A
COMPANY,  YOU  REPRESENT  THAT  YOU  ARE  AUTHORIZED  TO BIND THE
COMPANY TO THIS AGREEMENT.

Cadence  Design  Systems,  Inc.  ("Cadence")  is  licensing   the
software  program  ("Program")  provided  hereunder under an open
source arrangement.  The licensee hereunder  may  use,  copy  and
modify  the  Program  only  pursuant  to  this  Agreement.  While
Cadence  encourages   any   and   all   improvements   or   other
modifications  made  to  the  Program  to  be  contributed to the
community source and thereby made available to others  under  the
same  terms and conditions as included in this Agreement, this is
not required.  However, any error corrections made to the Program
must be contributed to the community source.


1.      DEFINITIONS

1.1     "Contribution"  means  the  submission  of  the  Original
Program  by  Cadence  and  the  submission  of any modifications,
improvements, additions, corrections  or  other  changes  to  the
Program,  including source code, object code, application program
interface definitions and formats, and documentation, made by any
Contributor  where  such  changes and/or additions to the Program
originate  from  and   are   distributed   by   that   particular
Contributor.   Each  Contributor  acknowledges and agrees that no
guarantee is provided  that  a  Contribution  shall  be  included
within   the   Program   as  distributed  by  any  Recipient.   A
Contribution  must  be  made  by  a  Contributor  if;  (1)   such
Contribution  is  an  error correction to the Program, or (2) the
Contributor  commercially  distributes  the  Program  with   such
Contribution,  in which case the Contribution must be made within
thirty (30) days of the commercial distribution of  the  Program.
"Commercially distributes" as used herein shall mean distribution
of the Program by a  Contributor  in  consideration  for  revenue
received.   A  Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it
was added to the Program by such  Contributor  itself  or  anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
additions to the Program  which:  (i)  are  separate  modules  of
software  or  data  distributed  in  conjunction with the Program
under their own license agreement, and (ii)  are  not  derivative
works of the Program.

1.2     "Contributor" means Cadence and  any  other  entity  that
distributes the Program.

1.3     "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable  by  any
Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of
its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

1.4     "Original Program" means  the  original  version  of  the
software  accompanying  this  Agreement  as  released by Cadence,
including source code, object code, application program interface
definitions and formats, and documentation, if any.

1.5     "Program" means the Original Program and Contributions.

1.6     "Recipient" means anyone who receives the  Program  under
this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2.      GRANT OF RIGHTS

2.1     Subject to the terms and conditions  of  this  Agreement,
each  Contributor  hereby  grants each Recipient a non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to  reproduce,  prepare
derivative   works   of,   publicly  display,  publicly  perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of  such  Contributor,
in source code and object code format.

2.2     Subject to the terms and conditions  of  this  Agreement,
each  Contributor  hereby  grants each Recipient a non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents  to
make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution of such Contributor, if  any,  in  source  code  and
object  code  format  along  with  any documentation. This patent
license shall apply to the combination of  the  Contribution  and
the  Program  if,  at  the  time the Contribution is added by the
Contributor,  such  addition  of  the  Contribution  causes  such
combination  to  be  covered  by the Licensed Patents. The patent
license shall not apply to any other combinations  which  include
the Contribution.

2.3     Subject to the terms and conditions  of  this  Agreement,
Cadence  hereby grants each Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free trademark license, to  use  the  Cadence  trademarks
"LEF",  or  "DEF", in accordance with Cadences marking policies,
in connection with the license grants hereunder.

2.4     Recipient  understands  that  although  each  Contributor
grants  the  licenses  to  its Contributions set forth herein, no
assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program  does
not  infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of
any other entity. Each Contributor  disclaims  any  liability  to
Recipient  for  claims  brought  by  any  other  entity  based on
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.  As  a
condition   to   exercising   the  rights  and  licenses  granted
hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole  responsibility  to
secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
example, if a third party patent license  is  required  to  allow
Recipient   to   distribute   the   Program,  it  is  Recipient's
responsibility to acquire that license  before  distributing  the
Program.

2.5     Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it  has
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
the copyright license set forth in  this  Agreement.   Except  as
expressly  stated  in  Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 above, Recipient
receives no rights or licenses to the  intellectual  property  of
any  Contributor  under  this  Agreement,  whether  expressly, by
implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.


3.      DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

3.1     A Contributor may choose to  distribute  the  Program  in
object  code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
(a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this  Agreement;
and   (b)  the terms and conditions of its license agreement: (i)
effectively  disclaims  on  behalf  of   all   Contributors   all
warranties   and   conditions,  express  and  implied,  including
warranties or  conditions  of  title  and  non-infringement,  and
implied  warranties  or conditions of merchantability and fitness
for a particular purpose;

(ii) effectively excludes  on  behalf  of  all  Contributors  all
liability  for  damages,  including,  but not limited to, direct,
indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages;

(iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;
and

(iv) states that source code for the Program  is  available  from
such  Contributor,  and  informs  licensees how to obtain it in a
reasonable manner on or through a  medium  customarily  used  for
software exchange.

3.2     When the Program is made available in source code form it
must  be  made  available  under the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.  A copy of this Agreement must be included  with  each
copy  of  such  Program.   A Contributor may not charge a fee for
the distribution of the source code of the Program.

3.3     Each Contributor must preserve all  copyright  and  other
notices   that   appear   in  the  Program.   In  addition,  each
Contributor  must  identify  itself  as  the  originator  of  its
Contribution,   if  any,  in  a  manner  that  reasonably  allows
subsequent  Recipients  to  identify  the   originator   of   the
Contribution.

3.4     While  this  license  is  intended  to   facilitate   the
commercial  use  of the Program, the Contributor who includes the
Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a  commercial
product  offering,  such  Contributor  ("Commercial Contributor")
hereby agrees to defend and  indemnify  every  other  Contributor
("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs
(collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits  and  other
legal  actions  brought  by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
section  do  not  apply  to  any claims or Losses relating to any
actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to
qualify,  an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the
Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
Commercial   Contributor  to  control,  and  cooperate  with  the
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations.  The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any
such claim at its own expense.


4.      NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE  PROGRAM  IS
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
ANY  KIND,  EITHER  EXPRESS   OR   IMPLIED   INCLUDING,   WITHOUT
LIMITATION,   ANY   WARRANTIES   OR  CONDITIONS  OF  TITLE,  NON-
INFRINGEMENT,  MERCHANTABILITY  OR  FITNESS  FOR   A   PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes
all  risks  associated  with  its  exercise  of rights under this
Agreement, including but not limited to the risks  and  costs  of
program  errors,  compliance  with  applicable laws, damage to or
loss of  data,  programs  or  equipment,  and  unavailability  or
interruption of operations.

5.      DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT  AS  EXPRESSLY  SET  FORTH  IN  THIS  AGREEMENT,   NEITHER
RECIPIENT  NOR  ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY
DIRECT,   INDIRECT,   INCIDENTAL,    SPECIAL,    EXEMPLARY,    OR
CONSEQUENTIAL   DAMAGES   (INCLUDING   WITHOUT   LIMITATION  LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY,  WHETHER
IN  CONTRACT,  STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR  DISTRIBUTION  OF
THE  PROGRAM  OR   THE  EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER,
EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

6.      GENERAL

6.1     If  any  provision  of  this  Agreement  is  invalid   or
unenforceable  under  applicable  law,  it  shall  not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of  this
Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum  extent  necessary  to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

6.2     If  Recipient  institutes  patent  litigation  against  a
Contributor  with  respect  to  a  patent  applicable to software
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then  any
patent  licenses  granted  by  that Contributor to such Recipient
under  this  Agreement  shall  terminate  as  of  the  date  such
litigation  is  filed.  If Recipient institutes patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in  a
lawsuit) alleging that the Program (excluding combinations of the
Program  with  other  software  or   hardware)   infringes   such
Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the  date  such  litigation  is
filed.

6.3     If a  Commercial  Contributor  distributes  any  Program,
which  includes  such  Contributors  modifications, improvements,
additions, corrections or other  changes,  and  has  not  made  a
Contribution  of  such  Program,  any  licenses  granted  to such
Commercial Contributor under this Agreement shall terminate as of
the date of such Program is distributed.

6.4     All  Recipient's  rights  under  this   Agreement   shall
terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or
conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in  a
reasonable   period   of   time  after  becoming  aware  of  such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's  rights  under  this  Agreement
terminate,  Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the
Program as soon as reasonably practicable.  However,  Recipient's
obligations  under  this  Agreement  and  any licenses granted by
Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

6.5     Cadence may publish new versions (including revisions) of
this  Agreement  from  time  to  time.  Each  new  version of the
Agreement will be given  a  distinguishing  version  number.  The
Program  (including  Contributions)  may  always  be  distributed
subject to the version  of  the  Agreement  under  which  it  was
received.  In  addition,  after a new version of the Agreement is
published,  Contributor  may  elect  to  distribute  the  Program
(including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other
than Cadence has the right to modify this Agreement.

6.6     This Agreement is governed by the laws of  the  State  of
California  and  the  intellectual  property  laws  of the United
States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a  legal
action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of
action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any
resulting litigation.

freetype version unknown
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
The  FreeType 2  font  engine is  copyrighted  work and  cannot be  used
legally  without a  software license.   In  order to  make this  project
usable  to a vast  majority of  developers, we  distribute it  under two
mutually exclusive open-source licenses.

This means  that *you* must choose  *one* of the  two licenses described
below, then obey  all its terms and conditions when  using FreeType 2 in
any of your projects or products.

  - The FreeType License, found in  the file `FTL.TXT', which is similar
    to the original BSD license *with* an advertising clause that forces
    you  to  explicitly cite  the  FreeType  project  in your  product's
    documentation.  All  details are in the license  file.  This license
    is  suited  to products  which  don't  use  the GNU  General  Public
    License.

    Note that  this license  is  compatible  to the  GNU General  Public
    License version 3, but not version 2.

  - The GNU General Public License version 2, found in  `GPLv2.TXT' (any
    later version can be used  also), for programs which already use the
    GPL.  Note  that the  FTL is  incompatible  with  GPLv2 due  to  its
    advertisement clause.

The contributed BDF and PCF drivers come with a license similar  to that
of the X Window System.  It is compatible to the above two licenses (see
file src/bdf/README and src/pcf/README).

The gzip module uses the zlib license (see src/gzip/zlib.h) which too is
compatible to the above two licenses.

Note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as this project
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
 v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.

 HOWEVER, in order to allow a migration to GPLv3 if that seems like
 a good idea, I also ask that people involved with the project make
 their preferences known. In particular, if you trust me to make that
 decision, you might note so in your copyright message, ie something
 like

	This file is licensed under the GPL v2, or a later version
	at the discretion of Linus.

  might avoid issues. But we can also just decide to synchronize and
  contact all copyright holders on record if/when the occasion arises.

Note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as this project
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
 v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.

 HOWEVER, in order to allow a migration to GPLv3 if that seems like
 a good idea, I also ask that people involved with the project make
 their preferences known. In particular, if you trust me to make that
 decision, you might note so in your copyright message, ie something
 like

	This file is licensed under the GPL v2, or a later version
	at the discretion of Linus.

  might avoid issues. But we can also just decide to synchronize and
  contact all copyright holders on record if/when the occasion arises.

ansi2knr is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY. No author or distributor accepts responsibility to anyone for the
consequences of using it or for whether it serves any particular purpose or
works at all, unless he says so in writing. Refer to the GNU General Public
License (the "GPL") for full details.

Everyone is granted permission to copy, modify and redistribute ansi2knr,
but only under the conditions described in the GPL. A copy of this license
is supposed to have been given to you along with ansi2knr so you can know
your rights and responsibilities. It should be in a file named COPYLEFT,
or, if there is no file named COPYLEFT, a file named COPYING. Among other
things, the copyright notice and this notice must be preserved on all
copies.

We explicitly state here what we believe is already implied by the GPL: if
the ansi2knr program is distributed as a separate set of sources and a
separate executable file which are aggregated on a storage medium together
with another program, this in itself does not bring the other program under
the GPL, nor does the mere fact that such a program or the procedures for
constructing it invoke the ansi2knr executable bring any other part of the
program under the GPL.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.


  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.


                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.


  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.


  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.


  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.


  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.


  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.


  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

          Version (or portions of such combination).

          (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
          effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
          the Covered Code.

          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
          granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
          Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
          3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
          Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
          by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
          that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
     Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.

               (c)    Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
          this License.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
     terms You offer.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
     understand it.

5. Application of this License.

     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
     will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
     Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
     this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
     shall survive.

     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
     the 60 day notice period specified above.

     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
     Participant.

     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
     license.

     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
     prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
     rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
     License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

ABSTRACT
========

   UPX and UCL are copyrighted software distributed under the terms
   of the GNU General Public License (hereinafter the "GPL").

   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part
   of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The
   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing
   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.

   As a special exception we grant the free usage of UPX for all
   executables, including commercial programs.
   See below for details and restrictions.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
==========================

   UPX and the UCL library are free software; you can redistribute them
   and/or modify them under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
   published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of
   the License, or (at your option) any later version.

   UPX and UCL are distributed in the hope that they will be useful,
   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
   GNU General Public License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
   along with this program; see the file COPYING.


SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR COMPRESSED EXECUTABLES
============================================

   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part
   of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The
   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing
   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.

   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special
   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs
   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:

   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX
      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)
      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as
      distributed by us.
   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.
      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical
      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.
   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get
      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at
      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,
      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.


ANNOTATIONS
===========

  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for
    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.

  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX
    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,
    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your
    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to
    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.

  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use
    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we
    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects
    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -
    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious
    by definition.

  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that
    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant
    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.

  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and
    similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to
    incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.

hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as a result
of any such terms Recipient offers.

by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
shall survive.

5. No Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any rights to use any

implied or statutory, which under any applicable law it might be deemed to

8. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any one
or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use, distribution,
import or sale of Subject Software (including particular functionality or code

      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

========

   UPX and UCL are copyrighted software distributed under the terms
   of the GNU General Public License (hereinafter the "GPL").

   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part
   of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The
   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing
   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.

   As a special exception we grant the free usage of UPX for all
   executables, including commercial programs.
   See below for details and restrictions.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
==========================

   UPX and the UCL library are free software; you can redistribute them
   and/or modify them under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
   published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of
   the License, or (at your option) any later version.

   UPX and UCL are distributed in the hope that they will be useful,
   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
   GNU General Public License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
   along with this program; see the file COPYING.


SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR COMPRESSED EXECUTABLES
============================================

   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part
   of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The
   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing
   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.

   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special
   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs
   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:

   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX
      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)
      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as
      distributed by us.
   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.
      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical
      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.
   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get
      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at
      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,
      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.


ANNOTATIONS
===========

  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for
    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.

  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX
    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,
    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your
    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to
    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.

  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use
    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we
    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects
    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -
    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious
    by definition.

  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that
    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant
    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.

  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and
    similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to
    incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.

Subject to any third party claims, Silicon Graphics, Inc. ("SGI") hereby
grants permission to Recipient (defined below), under Recipient's copyrights
in the Original Software (defined below), to use, copy, modify, merge,
publish, distribute, sublicense and/or sell copies of Subject Software
(defined below), and to permit persons to whom the Subject Software is
furnished in accordance with this License to do the same, subject to all of
the following terms and conditions, which Recipient accepts by engaging in any
such use, copying, modifying, merging, publishing, distributing, sublicensing
or selling:

1. Definitions.

    (a) "Original Software" means source code of computer software code which
    is described in Exhibit A as Original Software.

    (b) "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion from the substance
    or structure of either the Original Software or any previous
    Modifications. When Subject Software is released as a series of files, a
    Modification means (i) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a
    file containing Original Software or previous Modifications and (ii) any
    new file that contains any part of the Original Code or previous
    Modifications.

    (c) "Subject Software" means the Original Software or Modifications or the
    combination of the Original Software and Modifications, or portions of any
    of the foregoing.

    (d) "Recipient" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
    under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
    entities, "Recipient" includes any entity which controls, is controlled

    definition, "control" of an entity means (a) the power, direct or
    indirect, to direct or manage such entity, or (b) ownership of fifty
    percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of
    such entity.

2. Redistribution of Source Code Subject to These Terms. Redistributions of
Subject Software in source code form must retain the notice set forth in
Exhibit A, below, in every file. A copy of this License must be included in
any documentation for such Subject Software where the recipients' rights
relating to Subject Software are described. Recipient may distribute the
source code version of Subject Software under a license of Recipient's choice,
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that (i)
Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, and (ii) the
license terms include this Section 2 and Sections 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 of
this License, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other terms
of such license. If Recipient distributes the source code version under a
different license Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, not by SGI. Recipient
hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as a result
of any such terms Recipient offers.

3. Redistribution in Executable Form. The notice set forth in Exhibit A must
be conspicuously included in any notice in an executable version of Subject
Software, related documentation or collateral in which Recipient describes the
user's rights relating to the Subject Software. Recipient may distribute the
executable version of Subject Software under a license of Recipient's choice,
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that (i)
Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, and (ii) the
license terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 of
this License, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other terms
of such license. If Recipient distributes the executable version under a
different license Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, not by SGI. Recipient
hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as a result
of any such terms Recipient offers.

4. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if Recipient fails to comply with terms herein and fails to cure
such breach within 30 days of the breach. Any sublicense to the Subject
Software which is properly granted shall survive any termination of this
License absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions which,
by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
shall survive.

5. No Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any rights to use any
trade name, trademark or service mark whatsoever. No trade name, trademark or
service mark of SGI may be used to endorse or promote products derived from
the Subject Software without prior written permission of SGI.

6. No Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights with respect to the
OpenGL API or to any software or hardware implementation thereof or to any
other software whatsoever, nor shall any other rights or licenses not
expressly granted hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or otherwise with
respect to the Subject Software. Title to and ownership of the Original
Software at all times remains with SGI. All rights in the Original Software
not expressly granted under this License are reserved.

7. Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. Recipient shall comply with all
applicable laws and regulations in connection with use and distribution of the
Subject Software, including but not limited to, all export and import control
laws and regulations of the U.S. government and other countries. Recipient may
not distribute Subject Software that (i) in any way infringes (directly or
contributorily) the rights (including patent, copyright, trade secret,
trademark or other intellectual property rights of any kind) of any other
person or entity or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express,
implied or statutory, which under any applicable law it might be deemed to
have been distributed.

8. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any one
or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use, distribution,
import or sale of Subject Software (including particular functionality or code
incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the third party's intellectual
property rights, Recipient must place in a well-identified web page bearing
the title "LEGAL" a description of each such claim and a description of the
party making each such claim in sufficient detail that a user of the Subject
Software will know whom to contact regarding the claim. Also, upon gaining
such knowledge of any such claim, Recipient must conspicuously include the URL
for such web page in the Exhibit A notice required under Sections 2 and 3,
above, and in the text of any related documentation, license agreement or
collateral in which Recipient describes end user's rights relating to the
Subject Software. If Recipient obtains such knowledge after it makes Subject
Software available to any other person or entity, Recipient shall take other
steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
calculated to inform those who received the Subject Software that new
knowledge has been obtained.

9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON- INFRINGING. SGI ASSUMES NO
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. SHOULD ANY SOFTWARE
PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, SGI ASSUMES NO COST OR LIABILITY FOR ANY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY),
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SGI OR ANY SGI LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY
DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
STOPPAGE, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY
TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.

11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising,
directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License.
Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc. from
and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or expenses (including the
payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of Recipient's use,
modification, reproduction and distribution of the Subject Software or out of
any representation or warranty made by Recipient.

12. U.S. Government End Users. The Subject Software is a "commercial item"
consisting of "commercial computer software" as such terms are defined in
title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations and all U.S. Government End Users
acquire only the rights set forth in this License and are subject to the terms
of this License.

13. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed so as to achieve as nearly as
possible the same economic effect as the original provision and the remainder
of this License will remain in effect. This License shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of
California as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely
within California between California residents. Any litigation relating to
this License shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal
Courts of the Northern District of California (or, absent subject matter
jurisdiction in such courts, the courts of the State of California), with
venue lying exclusively in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing
party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

    part of a product, or in any medium of storage, with any file that does
    contain Original Software or any previous Modification.

2. License Terms. All distribution of the Subject Software must be made

such breach within 30 days of the breach. Any sublicense to the Subject

7. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any one
or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use, distribution,

JIDE Software, Inc.
Copyright (c) 2002 - 2017 JIDE Software, Inc, all rights reserved.

SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR JIDE SOFTWARE, INC.'S PRODUCTS

IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY: This JIDE Software, Inc. ("JIDE") Software License Agreement ("SLA") is a legal agreement between you (an individual developer or a company of software applications) and JIDE for the JIDE software product accompanying this SLA, which includes computer software and may include associated source code, media, printed materials, and "on-line" or electronic documentation ("SOFTWARE PRODUCT"). By installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you agree to be bound by the terms of this SLA. If you do not agree to the terms of this SLA, do not install, use, distribute in any manner, or replicate in any manner, any part, file or portion of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed, not sold.

RIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. If the licensed right of use for this SOFTWARE PRODUCT is purchased by you with any intent to reverse engineer, decompile, create derivative works, and the exploitation or unauthorized transfer of, any JIDE intellectual property and trade secrets, to include any exposed methods or source code where provided, no licensed right of use shall exist, and any products created as a result shall be judged illegal by definition of all applicable law. Any sale or resale of intellectual property or created derivatives so obtained will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of all local, federal and international law.

GRANT OF LICENSE. This SLA, if legally executed as defined herein, licenses and so grants you the following rights:

Single Developer License. Single Developer License allows an individual developer to use APIs ("Application Programming Interface") provided by SOFTWARE PRODUCT in any number of projects that he or she is working on. A Single Developer License for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may not be shared or used by more than one individual developer. In a project that uses the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, each individual developer on the project requires a separate Single Developer License as long as they need to access JIDE API.

Source Code License. In addition to the license and rights granted above, JIDE grants you the right to use and modify the JIDE source provided you licensed source code. Different from developer license, source code license is licensed to a team. Each team only needs to purchase one copy of source code license and share it among those developers who have their own Single Developer License.

JIDE shall retain all right, title and interest in and to all updates, modifications, enhancements and derivative works, in whole or in part, of the JIDE Source Code created by you, including all copyrights subsisting therein, to the extent such modifications, enhancements or derivative works contain copyrightable code or expression derived from the JIDE source code; provided, however, that JIDE grants to you a fully-paid, royalty free license, to use copy and modify such updates, modifications, enhancements and derivative works or copies thereof for use as authorized in this LICENSE.

You may not distribute the JIDE source code, or any modified version or derivative work of the JIDE source code, in source code form.

JIDE require all developers in your project who plan to access JIDE source code signing on the source code license. As long as they signed, they become registered developers. An alternative to this is to let a delegate signs source code license as an organization. The delegate will be responsible for letting other developers who plan to access the source code reviewing this license agreement first before releasing them the access.

The source code contained herein and in related files is provided to the registered developer for the purposes of education and troubleshooting. Under no circumstances may any portion of the source code be distributed, disclosed or otherwise made available to any third party without the express written consent of JIDE.

Under no circumstances may the source code be used in whole or in part, as the basis for creating a product that provides the same, or substantially the same, functionality as any JIDE products.

The registered developer acknowledges that this source code contains valuable and proprietary trade secrets of JIDE. The registered developer agrees to expend every effort to insure its confidentiality. For example, under no circumstances may the registered developer allow to put the source code on an internal network where he or she has no control.

Due to the insecurity of Java byte-code, if you plan to use classes that built from the source code directly, you must agree to obfuscate the classes before distributing it to your customers.

SOURCE CODE IS SOLD AS IS. JIDE DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR SOURCE CODE.

Deployment License. There is no deployment license fee unless the number of your application deployments is larger than 1000 times of the number of developer licenses you purchased and you are unwilling to acknowledge using JIDE. You can acknowledge using JIDE by showing JIDE name and/or logo in about dialog, or splash screen or including this SLA in a license folder of your product release where has the licenses for all 3rd party libraries you are using or any other places where users can easily notice. If you are unwilling to acknowledge using JIDE, a one-time, perpetual deployment license fee will be applicable.

  Copyright (c) 1996-2000 Synopsys, Inc.    ALL RIGHTS RESERVED
  The contents of this file are subject to the restrictions and limitations
  set forth in the SYNOPSYS Open Source License Version 1.0  (the "License"); 
  you may not use this file except in compliance with such restrictions 
  and limitations. You may obtain instructions on how to receive a copy of 
  the License at
  http://www.synopsys.com/partners/tapin/tapinprogram.html. 
  Software distributed by Original Contributor under the License is 
  distributed on an "AS IS" basis, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either 
  expressed or implied. See the License for the specific language governing 
  rights and limitations under the License.

SYNOPSYS Open Source
SDC License Agreement

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS SYNOPSYS OPEN SOURCE LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS 
"Contribution" means: 

a) in the case of Synopsys, Inc., ("Synopsys"), the Original Program, and
b) in the case of each Contributor,
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was made by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means Synopsys and any other entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor that are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. A Licensed Patent only includes claims directed towards a data structure, algorithm, technique or method that is directly implemented by the Contribution alone or by the Contribution combined with the Program existing at the time the Contribution is made.

"Original Program" means the original version of the SDC format specification and reference implementation accompanying this Agreement as released by Synopsys, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.

"Program" means the Original Program and other Contributions.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS 
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under that Contributor's Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The scope of a Contributor's Licensed Patents shall be limited solely to the extent of that Contributor's Contribution. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations that include the Contribution.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS 
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:

Copyright © {date here}, Synopsys, Inc. and others. All Rights reserved.

In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. 

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL 
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Synopsys may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than Synopsys has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of California, without reference to conflict of laws principles. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
	with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
	fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
	its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
	
	This software is copyright (C) 1991-2010, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding.
	All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
	
	Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
	software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
	conditions:
	(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
	README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
	unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
	must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
	(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
	documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
	the Independent JPEG Group".
	(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
	full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
	NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
	
	These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
	not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
	acknowledge us.
	
	Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
	in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
	it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
	software".
	
	We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
	commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
	assumed by the product vendor.
	
	
	ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
	sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
	ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
	by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
	that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
	ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
	of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
	the foregoing paragraphs do.
	
	The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
	It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
	The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
	ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
	but is also freely distributable.
	
	The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
	To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
	been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
	"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
	resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
	GIF decoders.
	
	We are required to state that
	    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
	    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
	    CompuServe Incorporated."

**************************************************

Parts of this software have been adapted from the libpng package.      
Although this library supports all features from the PNG specification (as MNG descends from it) it does not require the libpng package.      
It does require the zlib library and optionally the IJG jpeg library, and/or the "little-cms" library by Marti Maria (depending on the inclusion of support for JNG and Full-Color-Management respectively. 

This library's function is primarily to read and display MNG animations. It is not meant as a full-featured image-editing component! It does however offer creation and editing functionality at the chunk level.                                                 

(future modifications may include some more support for creation and or editing)

MATHWORKS LIMITED LICENSE

IMPORTANT NOTICE

READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS MATHWORKS LIMITED LICENSE AGREEMENT
(THE "AGREEMENT") CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING THESE MATERIALS (AS DEFINED
BELOW).

THIS AGREEMENT REPRESENTS THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU (THE "LICENSEE")
AND THE MATHWORKS, INC. ("MATHWORKS") CONCERNING THE SOFTWARE AND
DOCUMENTATION MADE AVAILABLE FOR ACCESS HEREUNDER (COLLECTIVELY, THE
"MATERIALS").

BY ACCESSING THESE MATERIALS, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS.

  1.1. "Licensee" means you, whether an individual or an entity, to whom
  MathWorks grants the License, and who is responsible for complying with the
  contractual obligations of the License, and ensuring that anyone permitted
  access to the Materials also complies with such obligations.

  1.2. "Documentation" means the user guides, if any, accompanying delivery
  of the Materials, as may be updated from time to time, as well as any
  reports or other feedback that MathWorks may, in its sole discretion,
  provide to Licensee.  Documentation may be delivered in printed and/or
  online forms, and in one or more languages.

  1.3. "Licensor" means any person who, or entity which, grants a license
  to MathWorks to redistribute that person's or entity's intellectual
  property.

  1.4. "Materials" means the computer software delivered and licensed
  hereunder, including Documentation, enhancements and error corrections.

  1.5. "Third Party" means any person or legal entity that is not MathWorks
  or the Licensee.

2. LICENSE GRANT.  MathWorks hereby grants to Licensee, subject to the
terms of this Agreement, a nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license
(the "License") to use the Materials internally or for the purpose of
providing to MathWorks engineering feedback on the Materials, as the context
 may require.  In all cases, the Materials are licensed to you solely for
 use in conjunction with MathWorks products and services.

3. LICENSE RESTRICTIONS.  The License is subject to the express
restrictions set forth below. Licensee shall not, and shall not permit any
Third Party to:

  3.1. modify, or create any derivative work of, any part of the licensed
  Materials

  3.2. adapt, translate, copy, or convert all or any part of the Materials
  in order to create software or other materials, a principal purpose of
  which is (a) to perform the same or similar functions as the Materials or
  any other technology or materials licensed by MathWorks, or (b) to replace
  any component of the Materials or any other technology or materials
  licensed by MathWorks;

  3.3. rent, lease, or loan the Materials; use the Materials for supporting
   Third Parties' use of the Materials, time share the Materials, or provide
   service bureau use;

  3.4. disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer the Materials or otherwise
  attempt to gain access to its method of operation or source code (other
  than files provided for convenience in source code form by MathWorks);

  3.5. sell, license, sublicense, publish, display, distribute, disseminate,
  assign, or otherwise transfer (whether by sale, exchange, lease, gift, or
  otherwise) to a Third Party the Materials, any copy or portion thereof, or
  any License or other rights thereto, in whole or in part, without MathWorks'
  prior written consent;

  3.6. alter, remove, or obscure any copyright, trade secret, patent,
  trademark, logo, proprietary and/or other legal notices on or in copies of
  the Materials;

  3.7. use MathWorks' name, trade names, logos, or other trademarks of
  MathWorks or any of its affiliates or Licensors in any advertising,
  promotional literature or any other material, whether in written,
  electronic, or other form, distributed to any Third Party, except in the
  form provided by MathWorks, and then solely for purposes of identifying
  MathWorks' Materials;

  3.8. provide access (directly or indirectly) to the Materials via a web or
  network application other than the licensee's internal network;

  3.9. copy, make available for copy, or otherwise reproduce the Materials,
  in whole or in part, except either (a) as may be required for their
  installation into computer memory for the purpose of executing the
  Materials in accordance with this Agreement; or (b) to make a reasonable
  number of copies solely for back-up purposes provided that any such
  permitted copies shall reproduce all copyright, trade secret, patent, logo,
  proprietary and/or other legal notices contained in the original copy
  obtained from MathWorks; and/or

  3.10. republish the Documentation.

4. RETENTION OF RIGHT, TITLE AND INTEREST BY MATHWORKS AND ITS LICENSORS;
CONFIDENTIALITY.  The Materials shall at all times remain the property of
MathWorks and/or its Licensors and Licensee shall have no right, title, or
interest therein, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.  The
Materials are a commercially valuable product of MathWorks, the design and
development of which reflect the efforts of skilled development experts and
the investment of considerable time and expense. MathWorks claims and
reserves all rights and benefits afforded under all relevant laws and
regulations. Licensee shall take appropriate action by instruction,
agreement, or otherwise with any persons permitted access to the Materials,
so as to enable Licensee to satisfy its obligations under the terms of this
Agreement.  The Materials are proprietary information of MathWorks, and are
protected by copyright law, trade secret law and other applicable law.
Although MathWorks may consider a commercial release of the Materials, it
is under no obligation to do so and MathWorks reserves the right to alter
features, licensing terms, or other characteristics of any such commercial
release.

5. LICENSES FOR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE.  MathWorks has been granted licenses
to distribute certain Third Party software.  Certain MathWorks Materials
require the use of Third Party software products that may require a
separate license from such Third Parties to use those Third Party products.
Licensee agrees and acknowledges that, to the extent that the Materials
contain any Third Party software: (i) such Third Party software is provided
on an "as-is", pass-through basis, and as such is provided to Licensee
without warranty, indemnification, support or other representation by
MathWorks; and (ii) MathWorks bears no liability with respect to such Third
Party software.

6. TERM AND TERMINATION.  This Agreement shall continue until termination
by MathWorks or Licensee as provided below.  Either party may terminate this
Agreement at any time, for any reason, upon written notice to the other
party.  Upon termination, Licensee shall promptly return all but archival
copies of the Materials in Licensee's possession or control, or promptly
provide written certification of their destruction.

7. EXPORT CONTROL.  The Materials may be subject to U.S. export control
laws or other (U.S. and non-U.S.) governmental export and import laws and
regulations.  Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement or Third
Party agreement, Licensee's rights under this Agreement may not be
exercised by Licensee or any Third Party in violation of such laws and
regulations, nor may this Agreement be transferred to any party where
doing so would result in such a violation.  The terms of any limitation on
the use, transfer or re-export of the Materials imposed by MathWorks in any
Destination Control Statement or other document for the purpose of export
control shall prevail over any term in this Agreement.  It shall be
Licensee's responsibility to comply with the latest United States or other
governmental export and import regulations.

8. FEDERAL ACQUISITION.  This provision applies to all acquisitions of the
Materials and Documentation by, for, or through the federal government of
the United States.  By accepting delivery of the Materials or
Documentation, the government hereby agrees that this software or
documentation qualifies as commercial computer software or commercial
computer software documentation as such terms are used or defined in FAR
12.212, DFARS Part 227.72, and DFARS 252.227-7014.  Accordingly, the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and only those rights specified in this
Agreement, shall pertain to and govern the use, modification, reproduction,
release, performance, display, and disclosure of the Materials and
Documentation by the federal government (or other entity acquiring for or
through the federal government) and shall supersede any conflicting
contractual terms or conditions.  If this License fails to meet the
government's needs or is inconsistent in any respect with federal
procurement law, the government agrees to return the Materials and
Documentation, unused, to MathWorks.

9. FOR EUROPEAN UNION LICENSEES ONLY.  Any contractual provisions of this
Agreement contrary to laws implemented under Article 6 of Appendix V of the
European Union Software Directive or to the exceptions provided for in
Article 5(2) and (3) of such Appendix shall be null and void solely to the
extent decompiling, disassembling, or otherwise reverse-engineering of the
Materials is necessary to enable the Licensee to create an independent
program that is interoperable with the Materials or any other permitted
objectives specified by such laws implemented under such directive
(collectively, the "Permitted Objectives"), provided that any such
information gained is used solely for such Permitted Objectives.

10. ASSIGNMENT.  Licensee may not assign or otherwise transfer this
Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise, without the written consent of MathWorks.
In the case of any permitted assignment or transfer of or under this
Agreement, this Agreement or the relevant provisions shall be binding upon,
and inure to the benefit of, the successors, executors, heirs,
representatives, administrators and assigns of the parties hereto.
MathWorks may charge Licensee an administrative fee for any permitted
assignment.

11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  The Materials should not be relied on as the
sole basis to solve a problem or implement a design whose incorrect solution
or implementation could result in injury to person or property.  If the
Materials are employed in such a manner, it is at the Licensee's own risk
and MathWorks and its Licensors explicitly disclaim all liability for such
misuse to the extent allowed by law.  MathWorks' and its Licensors'
liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence or for any
other matter in relation to which liability by law cannot be excluded or
limited shall not be excluded or limited.  Except as aforesaid, (a) any
other liability of MathWorks and its Licensors (whether in relation to
breach of contract, negligence or otherwise) shall not in total exceed one
hundred dollars ($100.00); and (b) MathWorks and its Licensors shall have
no liability for any indirect or consequential loss (whether foreseeable or
otherwise and including loss of profits, loss of business, loss of
opportunity, and loss of use of any computer hardware or software).  Some
states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so the above exclusion or limitation may not apply
to Licensee.

12. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  The Materials are delivered "as is" and
MathWorks makes and the Licensee receives no additional express or implied
warranties.  MathWorks and its Licensors hereby expressly disclaim any and
all other conditions, warranties, or other terms of any kind or nature
concerning the Materials (including, without limitation, any with regard to
infringement, merchantability, quality, accuracy, or fitness for a
particular purpose or Licensee's purpose).  MathWorks also expressly
disclaims any warranties that may be implied from usage of trade, course of
dealing, or course of performance.  The Materials are provided with all
faults, and the entire risk of satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy,
and effort is with Licensee.  MathWorks does not warrant that the Materials
will operate without interruption or be error free.  Some states and
countries do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts,
so the above limitation may not apply to Licensee.  Licensee may also have
other rights which vary from state to state and country to country.
Licensee accepts responsibility for its use of the Materials and the
results obtained therefrom.

13. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION.  This Agreement shall be interpreted,
enforced and construed and the rights of the parties hereunder governed in
all respects by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United
States of America, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions, and
both parties consent to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts
located in said Commonwealth and consent to the service of process,
pleadings and notices in connection with any and all actions initiated in
such courts.  The parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and binding and may be enforced in any other
jurisdiction.  To the extent any governing law, treaty, or regulation is in
conflict with this Agreement, the conflicting terms of this Agreement shall
be superseded only to the extent necessary by such law, treaty, or
regulation.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be otherwise
unlawful, void, or otherwise unenforceable, that provision shall be
enforced to the maximum extent permissible.  In either case, the remainder
of this Agreement shall not be affected.  The parties agree that the U.N.
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply
to this Agreement.  The parties further agree that the Uniform Computer
Information Transactions Act, or any version thereof, adopted by any state,
in any form ("UCITA"), shall not apply to this Agreement.  To the extent
that UCITA is applicable, the parties agree to opt out of the
applicability of UCITA pursuant to the Opt-Out provision(s) contained
therein.

14. HEADINGS.  The inclusion of headings is for convenience of reference
only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of this
Agreement.

15. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement, together with any additional
license_addendum.txt file included with the Materials, contains the entire
understanding of the parties with regard to the Materials, and may not be
modified or amended except by written instrument, executed by authorized
representatives of MathWorks and Licensee.

Licensee shall take appropriate action by instruction, agreement, or otherwise with any persons permitted access to the Programs, so as to enable Licensee to satisfy its obligations under the terms of this Agreement, including disabling access to the Programs, in the event of a transfer of the License. Licensee shall include the following notice in the About Box, or similar visible location, of any Application it distributes, and in the applicable documentation distributed with each copy of the Application: "MATLAB(r). (c) 1984-[INSERT YEAR MATLAB VERSION PUBLISHED] The MathWorks, Inc." Licensee agrees to employ the same security measures to protect the Programs, Derivative Forms, and MATLAB Runtime as it uses to safeguard Licensee's own proprietary intellectual property, but in no event less than reasonable care. Programs may include Third Party software licensed to Licensee under these terms or under separate terms of Licensors that are accessible within the relevant Programs in the thirdpartylicenses.txt file. Should such Third Party software be provided under the Lesser General Public License, Licensee may make modifications of the work identified in Section 6 of the Lesser General Public License for Licensee's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. Any Third Party services or data accessible through an interface in a Program are governed solely by the Third Party's terms of use or Licensee's own agreement with the Third Party.

7. SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE SERVICE. During any Software Maintenance Service term, MathWorks shall provide its customary Software Maintenance Service for the Programs. As further described in the Program Offering Guide, Software Maintenance Service consists of: delivering subsequent releases of the Programs, if any, that are not charged for separately; exerting reasonable efforts to both (a) provide, within a reasonable time, workarounds for any material programming errors in the current release of the Programs that are directly attributable to MathWorks, and (b) correct such errors in subsequent releases, provided Licensee gives MathWorks sufficient information to identify the errors; and technical support for the current release. Technical support means assistance by telephone, web, and e-mail with the installation and/or use of the then-current release of the licensed Programs, including all available bug fixes and patches, and their interaction with supported hardware and operating systems ("Platforms"). Software Maintenance Service may include additional administrative support services for the licensed Programs and access to certain online features and services made available by MathWorks from time to time. Levels of support and services available may vary by License Offering. If Licensee's Software Maintenance Service expires, Licensee must pay applicable fees to resume lapsed Software Maintenance Service. MathWorks reserves the option to discontinue, in whole or in part, and at any time, offering Software Maintenance Service and/or technical support for any Program, feature of a Program, or Platform or to refuse to provide Software Maintenance Service to a Licensee whom it reasonably believes is in breach of this Agreement.

8. TERM AND TERMINATION.

8.1. Term. This Agreement shall continue until the earlier of termination by MathWorks or Licensee as provided below or the expiration of the term of all Licenses granted hereunder.

8.2. Termination by Licensee. Licensee may terminate a License at any time, for any reason. Licensee shall not be entitled to any refund if a License is terminated, except for License fees paid for any Programs for which the Acceptance Period has not expired at the time of termination.

8.3. Termination by MathWorks. MathWorks may terminate this Agreement and all Licenses granted hereunder by written notice to Licensee if Licensee breaches any material term of this Agreement, including failure to pay any License fees due, and Licensee has not cured such breach within sixty (60) days of written notification. MathWorks may immediately terminate this Agreement and all Licenses granted hereunder if, after requesting and failing to receive from the Licensee adequate assurances of compliance with the terms of this Agreement, MathWorks reasonably believes that Licensee is or is intending to breach any material term of this Agreement. MathWorks may immediately terminate upon notice this Agreement and all Licenses granted hereunder should Licensee breach the terms and conditions of Articles 2, 3, 6, and/or 10. If Licensee or any of its Affiliates commences or participates in any legal proceeding against MathWorks or any of MathWorks' Affiliates challenging or asserting any intellectual property rights in or against any of the Programs licensed hereunder, then MathWorks may, without waiving any other legal rights or remedies available to it, immediately terminate this License. The foregoing sentence only applies to (a) a Licensee who has as its principal business the holding of patents and who does not engage, either directly or through an Affiliate, in any material active business of making products that embody the patents or (b) a Licensee who engages, either directly or through an Affiliate, in a principal business of licensing or making available commercial off the shelf software to Third Parties. The provisions of this Article 8.3 apply to all Licenses, including Perpetual Licenses.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon termination for any reason, Licensee shall promptly return all but archival copies of the Programs in Licensee's possession or control, or promptly provide written certification of their destruction.

8.5. Survival. The following provisions survive any termination of this Agreement: Articles 1, 3, 6, 8-11, and 13-23.

8.6. Effect of Termination on Applications. Termination of this Agreement will not affect the terms of any Application Licenses for Applications that have been placed in use prior to the effective date of termination.

9. PUBLICITY. Licensee may not use MathWorks' name, trade names, logos, or other trademarks of MathWorks or any of its Affiliates or Licensors in any advertising, promotional literature or any other material, whether in written, electronic, or other form, distributed to any Third Party, except in the form provided by MathWorks, and then solely for purposes of identifying MathWorks' Programs.

10. EXPORT CONTROL. The Programs are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to applicable export and import laws and regulations in other jurisdictions. Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement or Third Party agreement, Licensee's rights under this Agreement may not be exercised by Licensee or any Third Party in violation of such laws and regulations, nor may this Agreement be transferred to any party where doing so would result in such a violation. The terms of any limitation on the use, transfer or re-export of the Programs included in any Destination Control Statement or other document provided by MathWorks for the purpose of export control shall prevail over any term in this Agreement. It shall be Licensee's responsibility to comply with the latest United States or other governmental export and import regulations with respect to all use of the Programs and Applications.

11. FEDERAL ACQUISITION. This provision applies to all acquisitions of the Programs and Documentation by, for, or through the federal government of the United States. By accepting delivery of the Programs or Documentation, the government hereby agrees that this software or documentation qualifies as commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used or defined in FAR 12.212, DFARS Part 227.72, and DFARS 252.227-7014. Accordingly, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and only those rights specified in this Agreement, shall pertain to and govern the use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, and disclosure of the Programs and Documentation by the federal government (or other entity acquiring for or through the federal government) and shall supersede any conflicting contractual terms or conditions. If this License fails to meet the government's needs or is inconsistent in any respect with federal procurement law, the government agrees to return the Programs and Documentation, unused, to MathWorks.

12. EUROPEAN UNION SOFTWARE DIRECTIVE. For any Licensed User properly licensed to use the Programs within the European Union, any contractual provisions of this Agreement contrary to laws implemented pursuant to Article 6 of Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs or to the exceptions provided for in Article 5(2) and (3) of such Directive shall be null and void solely to the extent decompiling, disassembling, or otherwise reverse-engineering of the Programs is necessary to enable the Licensee to achieve the interoperability of an independently created program with the Programs or any other permitted objectives specified by such laws implemented under such Directive (collectively, the "Permitted Objectives"), consistent with the Directive, provided that any such information gained is used solely for such Permitted Objectives and solely in the European Union.

13. TAXES, DUTIES, CUSTOMS. Absent appropriate exemption certificates or other conclusive proof of tax exempt status, Licensee shall pay all applicable sales, use, excise, value-added, and other taxes, duties, levies, assessments, and governmental charges payable in connection with this Agreement or the Licenses granted hereunder, excluding taxes based on or measured by MathWorks' income, for which MathWorks shall be solely responsible.

14. ASSIGNMENT. Licensee may not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any License hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without the written consent of MathWorks. Licensee agrees that MathWorks may withhold such consent if it reasonably believes that Licensee is in breach of this Agreement or that the proposed assignment or transfer will cause a breach of this Agreement. In the case of any permitted or other lawful assignment or transfer, the terms of this Agreement including any License hereunder shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the transferee or assignee.

15. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. The Programs should not be relied on as the sole basis to solve a problem or implement a design whose incorrect solution or implementation could result in injury to person or property. If a Program is employed in such a manner, it is at the Licensee's own risk and MathWorks and its Licensors explicitly disclaim all liability for such misuse to the extent allowed by law. MathWorks' and MathWorks' Licensors' liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence or for any other matter in relation to which liability by law cannot be excluded or limited shall not be excluded or limited. Except as aforesaid, (a) any other liability of MathWorks and its Licensors (whether in relation to breach of contract, negligence or otherwise) shall not in total exceed the amount paid to MathWorks under this Agreement in the twelve month period preceding the claim in question, for the Program with respect to which the liability in question arises; and (b) MathWorks and its Licensors shall have no liability for any indirect or consequential loss (whether foreseeable or otherwise and including loss of profits, loss of business, loss of opportunity, and loss of use of any computer hardware or software). Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion or limitation may not apply to Licensee. Licensee agrees that prior to using or distributing any Application, it will thoroughly test and validate the Application and will be solely responsible for any problems or failures.

16. LIMITED WARRANTY/LIMITATION OF REMEDIES. MathWorks warrants that MathWorks, on its own behalf or through its Licensors, has the right to grant the License rights hereunder. MathWorks warrants that the physical media provided shall be free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days from delivery, or it will be replaced by MathWorks at no cost to Licensee. MathWorks further warrants, for a period of one (1) year from delivery or for the term of the License, whichever is less, that each copy of each Program will conform in all material respects to the description of such Program's operation in the Documentation. In the event that a Program does not operate as warranted, Licensee's exclusive remedy and MathWorks' sole liability under this warranty shall be the correction or workaround by MathWorks of major defects within a reasonable time. Should such correction or workaround be impractical, MathWorks may, at its option, terminate the relevant License and refund the initial License fee paid to MathWorks for such Program. All requests for warranty assistance should be directed to The MathWorks, Inc., 3 Apple Hill Drive, Natick, MA 01760-2098, U.S.A.

17. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. Except for warranties expressly set forth in Article 16 of this Agreement (or as implied by law where the law provides that the particular terms implied cannot be excluded by contract), any and all Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance Service are delivered "as is" and MathWorks makes and the Licensee receives no additional express or implied warranties. MathWorks and its Licensors hereby expressly disclaim any and all other conditions, warranties, or other terms of any kind or nature concerning the Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance Service (including, without limitation, any with regard to infringement, merchantability, quality, accuracy, or fitness for a particular purpose or Licensee's purpose). MathWorks also expressly disclaims any warranties that may be implied from usage of trade, course of dealing, or course of performance. Except for the express warranties stated in Article 16 of this Agreement, the Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance Service are provided with all faults, and the entire risk of satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy, and effort is with Licensee. MathWorks does not warrant that the Programs and Documentation will operate without interruption or be error free. Some states and countries do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to Licensee. The warranty in Article 16 gives Licensee specific legal rights and Licensee may also have other rights which vary from state to state and country to country. Licensee accepts responsibility for its use of the Programs and the results obtained from their use. MathWorks shall have no support or warranty obligations, and disclaims all liability, for Applications developed or distributed by Licensee. Licensee will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless MathWorks and its Licensors, officers, directors, employees, agents and resellers from and against any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable fees of MathWorks' attorneys) arising out of any Third Party claim or demand based on or arising from, out of or in connection with (i) the creation, use, or distribution of any Applications by Licensee or any of its Affiliates or (ii) the use of the Programs by Licensee or any of its Affiliates in breach of this Agreement.

18. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION. This Agreement shall be interpreted, enforced and construed and governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. Both parties consent to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the State of Delaware and consent to the service of process, pleadings and notices in connection with any and all actions initiated in such courts. The parties agree that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in Delaware shall be conclusive and binding and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction. To the extent that the acceptance of a contractual term contained in this Agreement is prohibited by reason of Licensee's sovereign immunity or any foreign, federal or state constitution, law, treaty, or regulation, the conflicting term of this Agreement shall be superseded only to the extent required. If any provision of this Agreement shall be otherwise unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible. In either case, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected. The parties agree that neither the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods nor the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, or any version thereof, in any form ("UCITA"), shall apply to this Agreement. To the extent that UCITA is applicable by reason of its adoption in a state, the parties agree to opt out of the applicability of UCITA pursuant to their Opt-Out provision(s).

19. COMPLIANCE WITH LICENSES. Licensee agrees to notify MathWorks promptly upon discovery of any failure to comply with this Agreement. Licensee agrees that, no more than once every twelve (12) months or within a reasonable time after a transfer, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity, MathWorks or its authorized representative shall, upon reasonable prior notice, have the right to inspect Licensee's and Licensee's Affiliates' records, systems, and facilities, during normal business hours, to verify that Licensee's and its Affiliates' use of the Programs is in conformity with valid licenses and otherwise complies with this Agreement. If a verification discloses that Licensee's or any of its Affiliates' use is not in conformity with a valid license, Licensee shall immediately take all necessary steps to cure any past defaults, including paying any unpaid license fees, to bring Licensee's or any of its Affiliates' use into conformity.

20. LICENSE MANAGEMENT AND USAGE INFORMATION. The Programs contain technology for license management and for the prevention of unlicensed use. When Programs are activated, installed, or first used by a Licensed User, and periodically for license management and product improvement purposes, information about the License, use of the Programs, and the Computer will be transmitted to MathWorks. This data includes the License information, Computer identification, and location. Some License Offerings also require the MathWorks Account information and the operating system user name for the Licensed User. See MathWorks privacy policy at www.mathworks.com/privacy.

21. HEADINGS. The inclusion of headings is for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

22. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties and may not be modified, amended, or superseded except by a written agreement signed by MathWorks and Licensee. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and any purchase order executed by Licensee (whether executed before or after this Agreement), this Agreement shall prevail.

23.14. "MATLAB Runtime" means MATLAB Runtime support libraries and other files for deployment of Applications.

23.15. "Object Code" means the code created by a system compiler from source code; also called "machine-readable code." Object Code can be Linked with an appropriate linker to resolve address references and may be combined with other Object Code for targeted execution on a specific processor. Object Code includes "Object Code libraries" and "shared libraries," which are groupings of Object Code for specific purposes.

23.16. "Perpetual License" means the right to use the License indefinitely provided that the Licensee always remains in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

23.17. "Program" means the software licensed hereunder, including Program Components, Documentation, enhancements, and error corrections. Each product licensed hereunder is a separate Program.

Any fees that may be due to any cloud providers for use of their platforms, programs, or services are separate and are the responsibility of the Licensee.

3.2. MATLAB Production Server

Licensed Users of MATLAB Production Server (MPS) are permitted to install and use MPS for the sole purpose of scheduling and running Applications generated with Licensee's validly licensed MATLAB Compiler Program, provided that the number of workers running simultaneously on one or more Computers does not exceed the number of MPS workers acquired. Licensee may make the Applications running on MPS accessible to end-users globally, including Third Parties, via a web interface, or other interface provided by Licensee, subject to the restrictions of Part Two, Section 3.1 of this document (Deployment Rights; MATLAB Compiler).



PART TWO: DEPLOYMENT RIGHTS

The Software License Agreement grants a Licensee and its Licensed Users ("you") the limited rights to install and use Programs in accordance with the License Offering you acquire. The Software License Agreement does not grant you the right to modify or distribute Programs or Program Components or create derivative works. This Part Two sets forth additional limited rights to modify, create derivative works of, and/or distribute certain Program Components as specifically set forth below.

Certain Programs, such as the MATLAB Compiler and the Coder Programs, generate output in the form of Source Code, Object Code, or other files and materials. For example, the MATLAB Compiler can be used to create an executable program, and MATLAB Coder and other Coder Programs can be used to generate Source Code in C and C++. Under certain circumstances described below, you are permitted to use and distribute the files, models, Applications, and Generated Forms that you create using the Programs.

Some Programs are technically prevented from being compiled, distributed, called from a web application, or used with MDCS.

All rights described below are limited by the restrictions of your License Offering, this Program Offering Guide, and the Software License Agreement.

1. Deployment Rights for User Files

You may distribute or sublicense User Files without restriction, provided that a principal purpose of the distribution or sublicense is not to replace or replicate a Program or any part of a Program and you otherwise comply with the general restrictions of the Software License Agreement and your License Offering. "User Files" are MATLAB code files, Simulink model files, MEX-files, MAT-files, VHDL-files, Verilog-files, FIG-files or P-files that you create and that do not include any code obtained from MATLAB code files, Simulink model files, MAT-files, VHDL-files, Verilog-files, TLC-files, P-code, C/C++ files or other Source Code files supplied with the Programs.

2. Deployment Rights for Derivative Forms

Your rights to create, use and distribute Derivative Forms are limited to those rights expressly set forth in this Section 2.

You may distribute Derivative Forms to Third Parties only (a) as expressly permitted in Section 3.4 (API Code) below, or (b) if the Third Party is bound by a Software License Agreement with MathWorks that requires such Third Party to treat such Derivative Forms received from you as its own Derivative Form under its Software License Agreement.

If you receive software that is a Derivative Form under a Third Party's Software License Agreement with MathWorks, or would otherwise be a Derivative Form under the terms of your Software License Agreement, then you must treat such software as a Derivative Form as if you modified or generated the software yourself.

3. Deployment Rights for Generated Forms and Applications

Your rights to create, use and distribute Generated Forms and Applications are limited to those rights expressly set forth in this Section 3.

No further license or royalty fees shall be due to MathWorks for deployment as expressly permitted in this Section, regardless of whether the deployment is solely for your Internal Operations or to Third Parties.

3.1. MATLAB Compiler

If you license the MATLAB Compiler, you may create and deploy Applications generated by the MATLAB Compiler that meet the requirements of this Section and comply with the restrictions in the Software License Agreement.

These Applications may include compiled versions of MATLAB code files, but only as required for the Application and from Programs that you have licensed. You may also use and distribute the MATLAB Runtime together with these Applications for the sole purpose of running the Applications. However, you are prohibited from making copies of the MATLAB Runtime accessible to any Third Party separate from or for use other than with your Application, and from providing the MATLAB Runtime for service bureau or similar service use.

If you license the Parallel Computing Toolbox (PCT) and generate an Application using any functionality of the PCT, that Application may enable up to the number of workers provided by the PCT used to build the Application. End-users of your Application do not need to have a license to the PCT.

Your exercise of any of the rights granted here is subject to the restrictions in the Software License Agreement, including the following:

i) You may not distribute any library header files.

ii) You may not use your Application to enable access to the code generation capabilities of Programs or the capabilities of other Transformation Programs.

iii) Your Application may not provide capability similar to the capabilities of any of Programs, or provide functionality or behavior similar to that of the MATLAB command line or scripting and programming capabilities. Your Application also may not enable evaluation of end-user code or expressions.

iv) Your Application may not provide access to all or a substantial portion of a Program.

v) You must include the notice "MATLAB(r). (c) 1984 - [INSERT YEAR MATLAB VERSION PUBLISHED] The MathWorks, Inc." in your Application's About Box, or similar visible location, and in the applicable documentation distributed with each copy of your Application.

vi) You may not modify or remove any proprietary notices included with Programs or Program Components.

3.2. Coder Programs

This Section discusses the deployment rights MathWorks grants you in conjunction with your license and use of the Coder Programs: 1) MATLAB Coder, 2) Simulink Coder, 3) Embedded Coder, 4) HDL Coder, 5) Filter Design HDL Coder, and 6) Simulink PLC Coder.

The Coder Programs take content that you choose to input. Depending on the Coder Program you use, the input could be a Simulink model, a Stateflow diagram, or MATLAB code. The Coder Program then converts this input to code in C/C++, VHDL/Verilog or PLC structured text. You may copy and deploy these Generated Forms for use outside of the Programs.

In order to enable this output code to work, each of these Coder Programs will link in certain files proprietary to MathWorks, which may include C, C++, Assembly, linker command files, template makefiles, project files, or TLC source code files. You may only copy, modify, and deploy these proprietary MathWorks files in Source Code or Linked Object Code form for different development targets when used with the Coder Programs or with code generated by the Coder Programs as part of, and only as required by, a larger standalone application. A standalone application is an Application created using programming languages and tools other than the Programs, which executes outside of the Programs.

3.3. Simulink Real-Time

You may use Simulink Real-Time to develop Applications that include Object Code derived from Program Components of Simulink Real-Time that are required by the Application and that have been compiled or otherwise obtained from Simulink Coder on a single development Computer, download that Application to a target Computer, and distribute that Application beyond the target Computer.

3.4. API Code

Programs you license may include selected Source Code and shared Object Code library files that implement various documented application programming interface (API) capabilities.

You may use and modify such Source Code files solely for creation of your own Application. You may copy and distribute Object Code compiled from this Source Code, but only as either a standalone Object Code file or Object Code linked to your Application, and only for use with and deployment of your own Application.

You may use, copy and distribute shared Object Code library files from the Programs for deployment of your own Application, but only if a header file exists in the Program for the shared library file. However, you may not copy or distribute the header files. You may not transfer Source Code, development rights or development capabilities for any Source Code or Object Code from the Programs to any Third Party.

3.5. MAT-Files

You may create and distribute Applications that read MAT-files using the MAT-file API, but if you distribute such Applications to third parties, they must also implement MAT-file write capability.

4. Application License

If you are distributing an Application, you must accompany the Application with a written Application License. See the Glossary for Application License requirements. The only exceptions to this requirement are when you are distributing an Application solely for Internal Operations, or within an embedded system not covered by a license agreement.

Reinstating will provide access to all Software Maintenance Service services available at the time of reinstatement, including the latest versions of Programs licensed. Your quote to reinstate lapsed Software Maintenance Service for Programs will include fees for annual renewal, including any applicable back maintenance fees for the lapsed period, and reinstatement fees if applicable. A reinstatement fee is applied to Software Maintenance Service for any Program that has lapsed for more than 3 months beyond the renewal date. These fees are subject to change.


PART FIVE: GLOSSARY OF TERMS

"Academic Internal Operations" means the use of the Programs by enrolled students, employees (faculty and academic staff), and other academic staff (including visiting professors and researchers), provided that such other academic staff have been granted institution email accounts and internal network login privileges by the Licensee. Such use must be in accordance with the Educational Institutions License Use acquired, for the purpose of (i) in the case of employees and other academic staff, performing software administration, teaching, and noncommercial, academic research in their ordinary course; and (ii) in the case of enrolled students, meeting classroom requirements of courses and study offered by the Licensee.

Academic Internal Operations also includes the installation and use of the Programs in a data center, high performance computing center, or other academic computing resource controlled by Licensee ("Data Center") by any individual who has been granted access to the Data Center by Licensee for the purpose of performing software administration, teaching, or noncommercial academic research. In the case of Data Center use by an individual who is not an enrolled student, employee, or other academic staff of Licensee, downloading and use of any Programs on the individual's Computer or any other Computer not controlled by Licensee is expressly prohibited.

"Application" means binary executable software that runs independently of the Programs, consisting of one or more software files that Licensee has created by either (a) using a Program to compile or translate Licensee created Source Code or (b) incorporating or linking any part of any compiled Source Code, library file, or other Program Component provided with the Program. An Application must contain original code developed by Licensee and must provide substantial functionality not contained in, or provided by, the Program Components that are incorporated into such Application. If a software file created by a Licensee incorporates Program Components, but does not meet the requirements of the previous two sentences, then it is a Derivative Form (as defined below). An Application may contain Linked Object Code which, if such Object Code was not Linked to the Application and was a standalone file, would otherwise have been deemed a Derivative Form.

"Application License" means a license for an Application that contains terms and conditions that (a) are at least as restrictive as the terms and conditions of the Software License Agreement (b) explicitly exclude MathWorks and its Licensors from all liability for damages or remedies; (c) do not provide a warranty for any Program; (d) do not transfer or convey any use or deployment rights for any Program without MathWorks consent; and (e) prohibit the removal of any copyright, trademark, logo, proprietary rights, disclaimer or warning notice included on or embedded in any part of the deployed Application. Further, if Licensee's Application is generated with the MATLAB Compiler, then Licensee's Application License shall include or incorporate by reference the terms of the MATLAB Runtime License included in a text file at [MCR Install Directory]\[version_number]\MCR_license.txt located within the installation for the MATLAB Runtime.

"Coder Programs" means Simulink Coder, MATLAB Coder, Embedded Coder, HDL Coder, Filter Design HDL Coder, Simulink PLC Coder, and GPU Coder.

"Derivative Form" means a software file that Licensee has derived from one or more Program Components (including without limitation by incorporating, translating, or modifying, in whole or in part, any Program Component), and which, if modified or copied without MathWorks' authorization, would constitute a copyright infringement or breach of the Agreement. A software file created by Licensee which qualifies as an "Application" under the above definition shall not be deemed a Derivative Form.

"Generated Form" means the output of the Transformation Programs in the form of Source Code or Object Code, as well as such Source Code converted to Object Code or Linked forms.

"Internal Operations" means the use of a Program by employees, consultants, student interns, and software administration contractors of Licensee or an Affiliate on behalf of the Licensee or Affiliate.

"Linked" means an executable or loadable file created by a compiler or linker program combining Object Code module files.

"MATLAB Runtime" means MATLAB Runtime support libraries and other files for deployment of Applications created with the MATLAB Compiler. MATLAB Runtime is a Program Component of the MATLAB Compiler.

"Named User" means a Licensed User, that must be an individual, designated and identified by the Licensee as the "Named User" for a License to a Program, and in respect to the Network Named User License Option, listed in the Local License Options File.

"Object Code" means the code created by a system compiler from source code; also called "machine-readable code." Object Code can be Linked with an appropriate linker to resolve address references and may be combined with other Object Code for targeted execution on a specific processor. Object Code includes "Object Code libraries" and "shared libraries," which are groupings of Object Code for specific purposes.

"Program" means the software licensed under the Software License Agreement, including Program Components, Documentation, enhancements, and error corrections. Each product licensed is a separate Program.

"Program Component" means any portion of, or file provided with, a Program.

"Source Code" means human-readable program code written in a higher-level language such as C, C++, Java, MATLAB, MDL, SLX, VHDL, Verilog, or Fortran, which must be translated or compiled into machine-readable code before it can be executed by a computer. Source Code also includes header files and other human-readable files necessary for a Program to be compiled in the higher-level language.

"Transformation Programs" are the Programs listed in Part Three.

Each of the various packages, which is distributed by MinGW.org, is governed by its own individual copyright and licensing terms. In summary, for the most commonly deployed packages:

MinGW Runtime: All releases of the MinGW base runtime package, prior to release 4.0, have been placed in the public domain, and are not governed by copyright. This basically means that you can do what you like with the code.
Due to inadmissibility of the public domain concept, in certain jurisdictions, we have now chosen to adopt a MIT style license for the principal components of the MinGW runtime, from release 4.0 onwards; you may view this LICENSE, as it is filed in the source code repository. Note that this new license does not carry forward to needing to distribution of said license when you use the MinGW Runtime to build your source. It only covers the distribution of the library, in source or binary form or any part thereof such as mingwm10.dll.

w32api: In the case of releases prior to 4.0: you are free to use, modify and copy this package. No restrictions are imposed on programs or object files linked with this library. You may not restrict the the usage of this library. You may distribute this library as part of another package or as a modified package if, and only if, you do not restrict the usage of the portions consisting of this (optionally modified) library. If distributed as a modified package, then a copy of this notice must be included.
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND; without even the implied warranties of MERCHANTABILITY or of FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It only covers the distribution of the library, in source or binary form or any part thereof such as mingwm10.dll.

WSL: We have combined the MinGW runtime package and the w32api package into one, which we have dubbed WSL, (an acronym for Windows System Libraries). We have applied a MIT style license to the sources, (where this does not conflict with any existing licenses applying to specific sub-components). You may view this LICENSE, as it is filed in the source code repository. Note that this new license does not carry forward to needing to distribution of said license when you use the WSL to build your source. It only covers the distribution of the library, in source or binary form or any part thereof such as mingwm10.dll.
MinGW Profiling Code: MinGW profiling code is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, Version 2.
Binutils, GCC, GDB, GNU Make: All of the GNU development tools, such as GNU binutils, GCC, GDB and GNU Make, are governed by the terms of the GNU General Public License; (note that this may be GPLv2 or GPLv3, depending on the preferences of the upstream maintainers, and the specific version of each package which you choose to install; in most cases, the most recent versions are likely to be GPLv3, while older versions may be GPLv2).

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009-2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

MinGW-w64 licensing
*******************

The copyright and license notices have been divided in two files:
The notices in COPYING.MinGW-w64.txt (this file) apply only to
MinGW-w64 itself. These don't apply to the binaries built with
MinGW-w64 unless you specifically tell MinGW-w64 to link against
these parts, for example, by enabling profiling code.

In addition to the notices in this file, also the notices in
COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt apply to MinGW-w64. Some (possibly
all) notices in that file may apply also to the binaries built with
this version of MinGW-w64. The idea is that if you create binary
packages of your software with MinGW-w64, you can simply copy
COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt into your package to fulfill the
license requirements of the MinGW runtime.

If you think that not all notices apply to your package and want to
remove some of them, note that, for example, the gdtoa files always
get linked in if you use any printf-like function. So usually it is
easiest and safest to just keep all the notices.

DirectX and DDK headers
=======================

DirectX and DDK headers are under GNU LGPLv2.1+ (see the file
COPYING.LGPLv2.1) and copyrighted by various people. Using these
headers doesn't make LGPLv2.1 apply to your code, because these
headers files contain only data structure definitions, short
macros, and short inline functions. Here is the relevant part
from LGPLv2.1 section 5 paragraph 4:

    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small
    inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use
    of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it
    is legally a derivative work.

FIXME: Cephes math lib
Copyright (C) 1984-1998 Stephen L. Moshier

It sounds vague, but as to be found at
<http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/12/msg00295.html>, it gives an
impression that the author could be willing to give an explicit
permission to distribute those files e.g. under a BSD style license. So
probably there is no problem here, although it could be good to get a
permission from the author and then add a license into the Cephes files
in MinGW runtime. At least on follow-up it is marked that debian sees the
version a-like BSD one. As MinGW.org (where those cephes parts are coming
from) distributes them now over 6 years, it should be fine.

This source may be freely distributed, however I would be interested in any
changes that are made. This driver takes packets off the IP i/f and hands them
up to a user process to have its wicked way with. This driver has it's roots in
a similar driver written by Phil Cockcroft (formerly) at UCL. This driver is
based much more on read/write/select mode of operation though.

End-User License Agreement
The latest version of the End-User License Agreement is available on-line at:
www.mentor.com/eula
END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (?Agreement?)
This is a legal agreement concerning the use of Software (as defined in Section 2) and hardware (collectively ?Products?)
between the company acquiring the Products (?Customer?), and the Mentor Graphics entity that issued the corresponding
quotation or, if no quotation was issued, the applicable local Mentor Graphics entity (?Mentor Graphics?). Except for license
agreements related to the subject matter of this license agreement which are physically signed by Customer and an authorized
representative of Mentor Graphics, this Agreement and the applicable quotation contain the parties? entire understanding
relating to the subject matter and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements. If Customer does not agree to these
terms and conditions, promptly return or, in the case of Software received electronically, certify destruction of Software and all
accompanying items within five days after receipt of Software and receive a full refund of any license fee paid.
1. ORDERS, FEES AND PAYMENT.
1.1. To the extent Customer (or if agreed by Mentor Graphics, Customer?s appointed third party buying agent) places and Mentor
Graphics accepts purchase orders pursuant to this Agreement (each an ?Order?), each Order will constitute a contract between
Customer and Mentor Graphics, which shall be governed solely and exclusively by the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
any applicable addenda and the applicable quotation, whether or not those documents are referenced on the Order. Any
additional or conflicting terms and conditions appearing on an Order or presented in any electronic portal or automated order
management system, whether or not required to be electronically accepted, will not be effective unless agreed in writing and
physically signed by an authorized representative of Customer and Mentor Graphics.
1.2. Amounts invoiced will be paid, in the currency specified on the applicable invoice, within 30 days from the date of such invoice.
Any past due invoices will be subject to the imposition of interest charges in the amount of one and one-half percent per month
or the applicable legal rate currently in effect, whichever is lower. Prices do not include freight, insurance, customs duties, taxes
or other similar charges, which Mentor Graphics will state separately in the applicable invoice. Unless timely provided with a
valid certificate of exemption or other evidence that items are not taxable, Mentor Graphics will invoice Customer for all
applicable taxes including, but not limited to, VAT, GST, sales tax, consumption tax and service tax. Customer will make all
payments free and clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding or other taxes; any such taxes imposed on payments by
Customer hereunder will be Customer?s sole responsibility. If Customer appoints a third party to place purchase orders and/or
make payments on Customer?s behalf, Customer shall be liable for payment under Orders placed by such third party in the event
of default.
1.3. All Products are delivered FCA factory (Incoterms 2010), freight prepaid and invoiced to Customer, except Software delivered
electronically, which shall be deemed delivered when made available to Customer for download. Mentor Graphics retains a
security interest in all Products delivered under this Agreement, to secure payment of the purchase price of such Products, and
Customer agrees to sign any documents that Mentor Graphics determines to be necessary or convenient for use in filing or
perfecting such security interest. Mentor Graphics? delivery of Software by electronic means is subject to Customer?s provision
of both a primary and an alternate e-mail address.
2. GRANT OF LICENSE. The software installed, downloaded, or otherwise acquired by Customer under this Agreement, including any
updates, modifications, revisions, copies, documentation, setup files and design data (?Software?) are copyrighted, trade secret and
confidential information of Mentor Graphics or its licensors, who maintain exclusive title to all Software and retain all rights not
expressly granted by this Agreement. Except for Software that is embeddable (?Embedded Software?), which is licensed pursuant to
separate embedded software terms or an embedded software supplement, Mentor Graphics grants to Customer, subject to payment of
applicable license fees, a nontransferable, nonexclusive license to use Software solely: (a) in machine-readable, object-code form
(except as provided in Subsection 4.2); (b) for Customer?s internal business purposes; (c) for the term of the license; and (d) on the
computer hardware and at the site authorized by Mentor Graphics. A site is restricted to a one-half mile (800 meter) radius. Customer
may have Software temporarily used by an employee for telecommuting purposes from locations other than a Customer office, such as
the employee?s residence, an airport or hotel, provided that such employee?s primary place of employment is the site where the
Software is authorized for use. Mentor Graphics? standard policies and programs, which vary depending on Software, license fees paid
or services purchased, apply to the following: (a) relocation of Software; (b) use of Software, which may be limited, for example, to
execution of a single session by a single user on the authorized hardware or for a restricted period of time (such limitations may be
technically implemented through the use of authorization codes or similar devices); and (c) support services provided, including
eligibility to receive telephone support, updates, modifications, and revisions. For the avoidance of doubt, if Customer provides any
feedback or requests any change or enhancement to Products, whether in the course of receiving support or consulting services,
evaluating Products, performing beta testing or otherwise, any inventions, product improvements, modifications or developments made
by Mentor Graphics (at Mentor Graphics? sole discretion) will be the exclusive property of Mentor Graphics.
 IMPORTANT INFORMATION
USE OF ALL SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO LICENSE RESTRICTIONS. CAREFULLY READ THIS LICENSE
AGREEMENT BEFORE USING THE PRODUCTS. USE OF SOFTWARE INDICATES CUSTOMER?S COMPLETE
AND UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.
ANY ADDITIONAL OR DIFFERENT PURCHASE ORDER TERMS AND CONDITIONS SHALL NOT APPLY.
3. BETA CODE.
3.1. Portions or all of certain Software may contain code for experimental testing and evaluation (which may be either alpha or beta,
collectively ?Beta Code?), which may not be used without Mentor Graphics? explicit authorization. Upon Mentor Graphics?
authorization, Mentor Graphics grants to Customer a temporary, nontransferable, nonexclusive license for experimental use to
test and evaluate the Beta Code without charge for a limited period of time specified by Mentor Graphics. Mentor Graphics may
choose, at its sole discretion, not to release Beta Code commercially in any form.
3.2. If Mentor Graphics authorizes Customer to use the Beta Code, Customer agrees to evaluate and test the Beta Code under normal
conditions as directed by Mentor Graphics. Customer will contact Mentor Graphics periodically during Customer?s use of the
Beta Code to discuss any malfunctions or suggested improvements. Upon completion of Customer?s evaluation and testing,
Customer will send to Mentor Graphics a written evaluation of the Beta Code, including its strengths, weaknesses and
recommended improvements.
3.3. Customer agrees to maintain Beta Code in confidence and shall restrict access to the Beta Code, including the methods and
concepts utilized therein, solely to those employees and Customer location(s) authorized by Mentor Graphics to perform beta
testing. Customer agrees that any written evaluations and all inventions, product improvements, modifications or developments
that Mentor Graphics conceived or made during or subsequent to this Agreement, including those based partly or wholly on
Customer?s feedback, will be the exclusive property of Mentor Graphics. Mentor Graphics will have exclusive rights, title and
interest in all such property. The provisions of this Subsection 3.3 shall survive termination of this Agreement.
4. RESTRICTIONS ON USE.
4.1. Customer may copy Software only as reasonably necessary to support the authorized use. Each copy must include all notices
and legends embedded in Software and affixed to its medium and container as received from Mentor Graphics. All copies shall
remain the property of Mentor Graphics or its licensors. Except for Embedded Software that has been embedded in executable
code form in Customer?s product(s), Customer shall maintain a record of the number and primary location of all copies of
Software, including copies merged with other software, and shall make those records available to Mentor Graphics upon
request. Customer shall not make Products available in any form to any person other than Customer?s employees and on-site
contractors, excluding Mentor Graphics competitors, whose job performance requires access and who are under obligations of
confidentiality. Customer shall take appropriate action to protect the confidentiality of Products and ensure that any person
permitted access does not disclose or use Products except as permitted by this Agreement. Customer shall give Mentor Graphics
written notice of any unauthorized disclosure or use of the Products as soon as Customer becomes aware of such unauthorized
disclosure or use. Customer acknowledges that Software provided hereunder may contain source code which is proprietary and
its confidentiality is of the highest importance and value to Mentor Graphics. Customer acknowledges that Mentor Graphics
may be seriously harmed if such source code is disclosed in violation of this Agreement. Except as otherwise permitted for
purposes of interoperability as specified by applicable and mandatory local law, Customer shall not reverse-assemble,
disassemble, reverse-compile, or reverse-engineer any Product, or in any way derive any source code from Software that is not
provided to Customer in source code form. Log files, data files, rule files and script files generated by or for the Software
(collectively ?Files?), including without limitation files containing Standard Verification Rule Format (?SVRF?) and Tcl
Verification Format (?TVF?) which are Mentor Graphics? trade secret and proprietary syntaxes for expressing process rules,
constitute or include confidential information of Mentor Graphics. Customer may share Files with third parties, excluding
Mentor Graphics competitors, provided that the confidentiality of such Files is protected by written agreement at least as well as
Customer protects other information of a similar nature or importance, but in any case with at least reasonable care. Customer
may use Files containing SVRF or TVF only with Mentor Graphics products. Under no circumstances shall Customer use
Products or Files or allow their use for the purpose of developing, enhancing or marketing any product that is in any way
competitive with Products, or disclose to any third party the results of, or information pertaining to, any benchmark.
4.2. If any Software or portions thereof are provided in source code form, Customer will use the source code only to correct software
errors and enhance or modify the Software for the authorized use, or as permitted for Embedded Software under separate
embedded software terms or an embedded software supplement. Customer shall not disclose or permit disclosure of source
code, in whole or in part, including any of its methods or concepts, to anyone except Customer?s employees or on-site
contractors, excluding Mentor Graphics competitors, with a need to know. Customer shall not copy or compile source code in
any manner except to support this authorized use.
4.3. Customer agrees that it will not subject any Product to any open source software (?OSS?) license that conflicts with this
Agreement or that does not otherwise apply to such Product.
4.4. Customer may not assign this Agreement or the rights and duties under it, or relocate, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the
Products, whether by operation of law or otherwise (?Attempted Transfer?), without Mentor Graphics? prior written consent and
payment of Mentor Graphics? then-current applicable relocation and/or transfer fees. Any Attempted Transfer without Mentor
Graphics? prior written consent shall be a material breach of this Agreement and may, at Mentor Graphics? option, result in the
immediate termination of the Agreement and/or the licenses granted under this Agreement. The terms of this Agreement,
including without limitation the licensing and assignment provisions, shall be binding upon Customer?s permitted successors in
interest and assigns.
4.5. The provisions of this Section 4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
5. SUPPORT SERVICES. To the extent Customer purchases support services, Mentor Graphics will provide Customer with updates and
technical support for the Products, at the Customer site(s) for which support is purchased, in accordance with Mentor Graphics? then
current End-User Support Terms located at http://supportnet.mentor.com/supportterms.
6. OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE. Products may contain OSS or code distributed under a proprietary third party license agreement, to
which additional rights or obligations (?Third Party Terms?) may apply. Please see the applicable Product documentation (including
license files, header files, read-me files or source code) for details. In the event of conflict between the terms of this Agreement
(including any addenda) and the Third Party Terms, the Third Party Terms will control solely with respect to the OSS or third party
code. The provisions of this Section 6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
7. LIMITED WARRANTY.
7.1. Mentor Graphics warrants that during the warranty period its standard, generally supported Products, when properly installed,
will substantially conform to the functional specifications set forth in the applicable user manual. Mentor Graphics does not
warrant that Products will meet Customer?s requirements or that operation of Products will be uninterrupted or error free. The
warranty period is 90 days starting on the 15th day after delivery or upon installation, whichever first occurs. Customer must
notify Mentor Graphics in writing of any nonconformity within the warranty period. For the avoidance of doubt, this warranty
applies only to the initial shipment of Software under an Order and does not renew or reset, for example, with the delivery of (a)
Software updates or (b) authorization codes or alternate Software under a transaction involving Software re-mix. This warranty
shall not be valid if Products have been subject to misuse, unauthorized modification, improper installation or Customer is not in
compliance with this Agreement. MENTOR GRAPHICS? ENTIRE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER?S EXCLUSIVE
REMEDY SHALL BE, AT MENTOR GRAPHICS? OPTION, EITHER (A) REFUND OF THE PRICE PAID UPON
RETURN OF THE PRODUCTS TO MENTOR GRAPHICS OR (B) MODIFICATION OR REPLACEMENT OF THE
PRODUCTS THAT DO NOT MEET THIS LIMITED WARRANTY. MENTOR GRAPHICS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
WITH RESPECT TO: (A) SERVICES; (B) PRODUCTS PROVIDED AT NO CHARGE; OR (C) BETA CODE; ALL OF
WHICH ARE PROVIDED ?AS IS.?
7.2. THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 7 ARE EXCLUSIVE. NEITHER MENTOR GRAPHICS NOR ITS
LICENSORS MAKE ANY OTHER WARRANTIES EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, WITH RESPECT TO
PRODUCTS PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. MENTOR GRAPHICS AND ITS LICENSORS SPECIFICALLY
DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL
MENTOR GRAPHICS OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR SAVINGS) WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER
LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF MENTOR GRAPHICS OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL MENTOR GRAPHICS? OR ITS LICENSORS? LIABILITY UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMER FOR THE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE LICENSE OR
SERVICE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. IN THE CASE WHERE NO AMOUNT WAS PAID, MENTOR GRAPHICS AND ITS
LICENSORS SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 8
SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.
9. THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.
9.1. Customer acknowledges that Mentor Graphics has no control over the testing of Customer?s products, or the specific
applications and use of Products. Mentor Graphics and its licensors shall not be liable for any claim or demand made against
Customer by any third party, except to the extent such claim is covered under Section 10.
9.2. In the event that a third party makes a claim against Mentor Graphics arising out of the use of Customer?s products, Mentor
Graphics will give Customer prompt notice of such claim. At Customer?s option and expense, Customer may take sole control
of the defense and any settlement of such claim. Customer WILL reimburse and hold harmless Mentor Graphics for any
LIABILITY, damages, settlement amounts, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney?s fees, incurred by or awarded
against Mentor Graphics or its licensors in connection with such claims.
9.3. The provisions of this Section 9 shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.
10. INFRINGEMENT.
10.1. Mentor Graphics will defend or settle, at its option and expense, any action brought against Customer in the United States,
Canada, Japan, or member state of the European Union which alleges that any standard, generally supported Product acquired
by Customer hereunder infringes a patent or copyright or misappropriates a trade secret in such jurisdiction. Mentor Graphics
will pay costs and damages finally awarded against Customer that are attributable to such action. Customer understands and
agrees that as conditions to Mentor Graphics? obligations under this section Customer must: (a) notify Mentor Graphics
promptly in writing of the action; (b) provide Mentor Graphics all reasonable information and assistance to settle or defend the
action; and (c) grant Mentor Graphics sole authority and control of the defense or settlement of the action.
10.2. If a claim is made under Subsection 10.1 Mentor Graphics may, at its option and expense: (a) replace or modify the Product so
that it becomes noninfringing; (b) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Product; or (c) require the return of the
Product and refund to Customer any purchase price or license fee paid, less a reasonable allowance for use.
10.3. Mentor Graphics has no liability to Customer if the action is based upon: (a) the combination of Software or hardware with any
product not furnished by Mentor Graphics; (b) the modification of the Product other than by Mentor Graphics; (c) the use of
other than a current unaltered release of Software; (d) the use of the Product as part of an infringing process; (e) a product that
Customer makes, uses, or sells; (f) any Beta Code or Product provided at no charge; (g) any software provided by Mentor
Graphics? licensors who do not provide such indemnification to Mentor Graphics? customers; (h) OSS, except to the extent that
the infringement is directly caused by Mentor Graphics? modifications to such OSS; or (i) infringement by Customer that is
deemed willful. In the case of (i), Customer shall reimburse Mentor Graphics for its reasonable attorney fees and other costs
related to the action.
10.4. THIS SECTION 10 IS SUBJECT TO SECTION 8 ABOVE AND STATES THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF MENTOR
GRAPHICS AND ITS LICENSORS, AND CUSTOMER?S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, FOR DEFENSE,
SETTLEMENT AND DAMAGES, WITH RESPECT TO ANY ALLEGED PATENT OR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
OR TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION BY ANY PRODUCT PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.
11. TERMINATION AND EFFECT OF TERMINATION.
11.1. If a Software license was provided for limited term use, such license will automatically terminate at the end of the authorized
term. Mentor Graphics may terminate this Agreement and/or any license granted under this Agreement immediately upon
written notice if Customer: (a) exceeds the scope of the license or otherwise fails to comply with the licensing or confidentiality
provisions of this Agreement, or (b) becomes insolvent, files a bankruptcy petition, institutes proceedings for liquidation or
winding up or enters into an agreement to assign its assets for the benefit of creditors. For any other material breach of any
provision of this Agreement, Mentor Graphics may terminate this Agreement and/or any license granted under this Agreement
upon 30 days written notice if Customer fails to cure the breach within the 30 day notice period. Termination of this Agreement
or any license granted hereunder will not affect Customer?s obligation to pay for Products shipped or licenses granted prior to
the termination, which amounts shall be payable immediately upon the date of termination.
11.2. Upon termination of this Agreement, the rights and obligations of the parties shall cease except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Upon termination of this Agreement and/or any license granted under this Agreement, Customer shall ensure that
all use of the affected Products ceases, and shall return hardware and either return to Mentor Graphics or destroy Software in
Customer?s possession, including all copies and documentation, and certify in writing to Mentor Graphics within ten business
days of the termination date that Customer no longer possesses any of the affected Products or copies of Software in any form.
12. EXPORT. The Products provided hereunder are subject to regulation by local laws and European Union (?E.U.?) and United States
(?U.S.?) government agencies, which prohibit export, re-export or diversion of certain products, information about the products, and
direct or indirect products thereof, to certain countries and certain persons. Customer agrees that it will not export or re-export Products
in any manner without first obtaining all necessary approval from appropriate local, E.U. and U.S. government agencies. If Customer wishes to disclose any information to Mentor Graphics that is subject to any E.U., U.S. or other applicable export restrictions, including
without limitation the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or special controls under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), Customer will notify Mentor Graphics personnel, in advance of each instance of disclosure, that such information
is subject to such export restrictions.
13. U.S. GOVERNMENT LICENSE RIGHTS. Software was developed entirely at private expense. The parties agree that all Software is
commercial computer software within the meaning of the applicable acquisition regulations. Accordingly, pursuant to U.S. FAR 48
CFR 12.212 and DFAR 48 CFR 227.7202, use, duplication and disclosure of the Software by or for the U.S. government or a U.S.
government subcontractor is subject solely to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, which shall supersede any
conflicting terms or conditions in any government order document, except for provisions which are contrary to applicable mandatory
federal laws.
14. THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY. Mentor Graphics Corporation, Mentor Graphics (Ireland) Limited, Microsoft Corporation and
other licensors may be third party beneficiaries of this Agreement with the right to enforce the obligations set forth herein.
15. REVIEW OF LICENSE USAGE. Customer will monitor the access to and use of Software. With prior written notice and during
Customer?s normal business hours, Mentor Graphics may engage an internationally recognized accounting firm to review Customer?s
software monitoring system and records deemed relevant by the internationally recognized accounting firm to confirm Customer?s
compliance with the terms of this Agreement or U.S. or other local export laws. Such review may include FlexNet (or successor
product) report log files that Customer shall capture and provide at Mentor Graphics? request. Customer shall make records available in
electronic format and shall fully cooperate with data gathering to support the license review. Mentor Graphics shall bear the expense of
any such review unless a material non-compliance is revealed. Mentor Graphics shall treat as confidential information all information
gained as a result of any request or review and shall only use or disclose such information as required by law or to enforce its rights
under this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 15 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
16. CONTROLLING LAW, JURISDICTION AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION. The owners of certain Mentor Graphics intellectual
property licensed under this Agreement are located in Ireland and the U.S. To promote consistency around the world, disputes shall be
resolved as follows: excluding conflict of laws rules, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of
Oregon, U.S., if Customer is located in North or South America, and the laws of Ireland if Customer is located outside of North or
South America or Japan, and the laws of Japan if Customer is located in Japan. All disputes arising out of or in relation to this
Agreement shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Portland, Oregon when the laws of Oregon apply, or Dublin,
Ireland when the laws of Ireland apply, or the Tokyo District Court when the laws of Japan apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all
disputes in Asia (excluding Japan) arising out of or in relation to this Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration in Singapore before a
single arbitrator to be appointed by the chairman of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (?SIAC?) to be conducted in the
English language, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the SIAC in effect at the time of the dispute, which rules are deemed to be
incorporated by reference in this section. Nothing in this section shall restrict Mentor Graphics? right to bring an action (including for
example a motion for injunctive relief) against Customer in the jurisdiction where Customer?s place of business is located. The United
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.
17. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void, invalid, unenforceable or
illegal, such provision shall be severed from this Agreement and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
18. MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement contains the parties? entire understanding relating to its subject matter and supersedes all prior
or contemporaneous agreements. Any translation of this Agreement is provided to comply with local legal requirements only. In the
event of a dispute between the English and any non-English versions, the English version of this Agreement shall govern to the extent
not prohibited by local law in the applicable jurisdiction. This Agreement may only be modified in writing, signed by an authorized
representative of each party. Waiver of terms or excuse of breach must be in writing and shall not constitute subsequent consent, waiver or excuse.

The text of the GNU Lesser General Public License, Version 2.1, a copy of which is made available below in Part Four of this document, was originally presented here, or as applicable, applies to the above-listed file(s).

RXTX License v 2.1 - LGPL v 2.1 + Linking Over Controlled Interface.
RXTX is a native interface to serial ports in java.

Copyright 1997-2007 by Trent Jarvi tjarvi@qbang.org and others who
actually wrote it.  See individual source files for more information.

A copy of the LGPL v 2.1 may be found at
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.txt on March 4th 2007.  A copy is
included below for your convenience.

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
Lesser General Public License for more details.

An executable that contains no derivative of any portion of RXTX, but
is designed to work with RXTX by being dynamically linked with it,
is considered a "work that uses the Library" subject to the terms and
conditions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The following has been added to the RXTX License to remove
any confusion about linking to RXTX.   We want to allow in part what
section 5, paragraph 2 of the LGPL does not permit in the special
case of linking over a controlled interface.  The intent is to add a
Java Specification Request or standards body defined interface in the 
future as another exception but one is not currently available.

http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#LinkingOverControlledInterface

As a special exception, the copyright holders of RXTX give you
permission to link RXTX with independent modules that communicate with
RXTX solely through the Sun Microsytems CommAPI interface version 2,
regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy
and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your choice,
provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete
copy of the source code of RXTX (the version of RXTX used to produce the
combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public License plus this exception.  An independent module is a
module which is not derived from or based on RXTX.

Note that people who make modified versions of RXTX are not obligated
to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
their choice whether to do so.  The GNU Lesser General Public License
gives permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
carries forward this exception.

SYNOPSYS Open Source
SDC License Agreement

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS SYNOPSYS OPEN SOURCE LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS 
"Contribution" means: 

a) in the case of Synopsys, Inc., ("Synopsys"), the Original Program, and
b) in the case of each Contributor,
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was made by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means Synopsys and any other entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor that are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. A Licensed Patent only includes claims directed towards a data structure, algorithm, technique or method that is directly implemented by the Contribution alone or by the Contribution combined with the Program existing at the time the Contribution is made.

"Original Program" means the original version of the SDC format specification and reference implementation accompanying this Agreement as released by Synopsys, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.

"Program" means the Original Program and other Contributions.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS 
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under that Contributor's Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The scope of a Contributor's Licensed Patents shall be limited solely to the extent of that Contributor's Contribution. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations that include the Contribution.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS 
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:

Copyright © {date here}, Synopsys, Inc. and others. All Rights reserved.

In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. 

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL 
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Synopsys may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than Synopsys has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of California, without reference to conflict of laws principles. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

This  License  Agreement  (the  "Agreement") is between  Jyloo Software  with  a 
 principal  place  of  business  at  Sonnenstr 10,  86874 Tussenhausen,  GERMANY 
 ("Licensor"), and the customer ("Licensee") identified  on the electronic order 
 form submitted on behalf of Licensee (the "Order Form").  
 
Licensor  agrees  to  license  its  Synthetica  Look  and  Feel  software   (the 
 "Software")  to  Licensee on  the  terms and  conditions  described more  fully 
 herein. Software means a complete and unchanged copy of the object code version 
 of the Synthetica software (including images) identified in the Order Form  and 
 posted on a download page of the Synthetica website (the "Download Page")  made 
 available to Licensee immediately after payment as provided in Section 3.  
 
By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Software, you are agreeing to  be 
 bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of  this 
 Agreement, you are not authorized to use the software. 
 
1.License  Grant.  Licensor  grants to  Licensee a  limited, non-exclusive,  non 
 -transferable, and worldwide right  to (a)  use, publicly  perform, display and 
 support the Software, and  (b) to copy, make  derivative works of, market,  and 
 distribute any portion  of the Software  directly and indirectly  to Licensee?s 
 end user customer in connection with  or as part of a Licensee  product without 
 modifying the Software. 
 
2.Restrictions.  Licensee shall not (a) provide its end user customers (each, an 
 ?End User?)  with any  versions of  the Software  on a  stand-alone basis;  (b) 
 sublicense, transfer  or assign  this License  Agreement or  any of  Licensee?s 
 rights or obligations under  this License Agreement, in  whole or in part;  (c) 
 remove or obscure any copyright and trademark notices relating to the Software; 
 (d) lease, license, use, make available,  distribute or modify all or any  part 
 of the  Software to  any third  party, except  as otherwise expressly permitted 
 herein;  (e) copy  the Software  onto any  public or  distributed network;  (f) 
 create derivate  works to  compete with  the Software;  (g) install, distribute 
 or  use  a  Small  Business  License  if  Licensee  employs  more   than    two  
 persons  total  (independent  from  their  internal  role) -  in  this  case  a  
 developer  independent  Site  License (Standard, Enterprise or Source Code)  is  
 required. 
 
 You may use the  unlicensed Software within your  company or organization for a 
 trial period  of up  to 30  days from  its supply  to you.  At the  end of this 
 period, if you do not purchase a  valid license you must destroy all copies  of 
 the  Software, including  copies installed  on any  computer, and  all related 
 documentation. Without a valid license  you may not distribute any  portions of 
 the Software to any third party. 
 
3.Payments.  No later than thirty (30) days after submission of the Order  Form, 
 Licensee shall pay Licensor the license fee on the date Licensee submitted  the 
 Order Form. All payments shall be made in Euros or U.S. dollars. Licensee shall 
 be responsible for  paying all local,  state, federal and  international sales, 
 value added, excise and other taxes and duties payable in connection with  this 
 License, other than taxes based upon Licensor's net income. Licensee shall  not 
 be permitted to access the Download Page until Licensor has received payment in 
 full. 
 
4.Termination.  Licensor may terminate this License immediately if the  Licensee 
 shall breach  any of  the provisions  of this  License and  such breach remains 
 uncured 30 days  after receipt of  notice. In the  event that Licensee  becomes 
 liquidated,   dissolved,  bankrupt   or  insolvent,   whether  voluntarily   or 
 involuntarily, or shall take any action to be so declared, Licensor shall  have 
 the right to terminate this License immediately. Upon expiration,  cancellation 
 or  other  termination  of  this  License,  Licensee  shall  immediately:   (a) 
 discontinue distribution of products that include the Software; and (b) destroy 
 all  copies  of  the  Software, including  (without  limitation)  as  linked or 
 compiled in any product. Sections 3 through 11 shall survive the termination of 
 this License for any reason.  
 
5.Support and Maintenance. 
 
(a)In  connection  with the  license  granted hereunder,  Licensor  will provide 
 Licensee with the following at no  additional charge: (a) free upgrades to  all 
 minor  revisions  of  the Software  as  long  as  a valid  Support Subscription  
 exists. 
 
(b)In addition, upon Licensee?s  request, Licensor shall provide  e-mail support 
 to Licensee with regard to the Software. Licensee shall pay Licensor a  Support 
 Fee  as specified  in the  Order Form  for each  year of  support. Such  e-mail 
 support shall entitle Licensee to receive a satisfactory response from Licensor 
 within seven (7) days of Licensee?s request for assistance. 
 
(c)Upgrades to Software major releases are  not part of this agreement. In  case 
 of Licensee requires a major upgrade a license agreement renewal is necessary.

 herein; (c) that the Software and licenses granted to Licensee are free of  any 
 and all restrictions, settlements, judgments or adverse claims; (d) to the best

 patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret  or other proprietary rights of  any 
 third party; (e) there is currently  no actual or threatened suit by  any third 
 party based on an alleged  infringement, misappropriation or violation of  such 
 rights by Licensor; and (f) no further consent from any other person or  entity

 Software shall  conform in  all material  respects with  the description of the 
 Software set forth in the documentation. 
 
(d)Services Warranty.  Licensor represents and warrants that each of  Licensor?s 
 employees,  agents  and  subcontractors   assigned  to  perform  any   services 
 hereunder, including training  or maintenance services,  shall have the  proper

 such  services  will  be  performed in  a  competent  and  professional manner. 
 Licensor further represents and warrants that each deliverable shall be subject 
 to each representation and warranty which applies to Software in this Section 5 
 (Representations and Warranties). 
 
(e)Disclaimer  of  Warranties.   LICENSOR  EXPRESSLY  DISCLAIMS,  AND   LICENSEE 
 EXPRESSLY  WAIVES,  ALL  WARRANTIES,  WHETHER  EXPRESS  OR  IMPLIED,  INCLUDING 
 WARRANTIES  OF   MERCHANTIBILITY,  FITNESS   FOR  A   PARTICULAR  PURPOSE,  NON 
 -INFRINGEMENT,  SYSTEM   INTEGRATION,   NON-INTERFERENCE   AND   ACCURACY    OF 
 INFORMATIONAL CONTENT.  LICENSOR DOES  NOT WARRANT  THAT THE  LICENSED SOFTWARE 
 WILL  MEET  LICENSEE'S  REQUIREMENTS  OR THAT  THE  OPERATION  OF  THE LICENSED 
 SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED. 
 THE ENTIRE  RISK OF  THE LICENSED  SOFTWARE'S QUALITY  AND PERFORMANCE  IS WITH 
 LICENSEE. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing disclaimer, Licensee 
 acknowledges  that  the  Licensed   Software  is  not  specifically   designed, 
 manufactured or intended  for use in  the planning, construction,  maintenance, 
 control or direct operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, control 
 or communication systems, weapons systems or direct life support systems. 
 
7.Proprietary Rights.  Licensee agrees that the copyright, patent, trade secrets 
 and  all  other  intellectual  proprietary rights  of  whatever  nature  in the 
 Software and related documentation,  including derivative works, are  and shall 
 remain  the  exclusive property  of  Licensor and  any  third party  suppliers. 
 Nothing in this License should be construed as transferring any aspects of such 
 rights to Licensee or any third party. Licensor reserves any and all rights not 
 expressly granted herein.  
 
8.Indemnification.  Licensee  hereby indemnifies  and agrees  to defend Licensor 
 against  any  and  all  damages,  judgments  and  costs  (including  reasonable 
 attorneys' fees) related to  any claim based upon:  (a) an allegation that  the 
 Licensee Application infringes the intellectual property of a third party;  (b) 
 use of the Software  in a manner prohibited  under this License or  in a manner 
 for which the Licensed Software was not designed; (c) integration or use of the 
 Software with the Licensee Application  (where use of the Software  alone would 
 not infringe);  (d) changes  made by  Licensee to  the Software  (where use  of 
 unmodified Software would not infringe); (e) changes made, or actions taken, by 
 Licensor upon Licensee's  direct instructions; or  (f) bodily injury,  property 
 damage or any  other damage or  injury due to  the use or  inability to use  an 
 Integrated Product. 
 
9.Limitation of Liability.  LICENSOR SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ITS 
 OBLIGATIONS UNDER  THIS AGREEMENT  OR OTHERWISE  FOR CONSEQUENTIAL,  EXEMPLARY, 
 SPECIAL,  INDIRECT,   INCIDENTAL  OR   PUNITIVE  DAMAGES,   INCLUDING  (WITHOUT 
 LIMITATION) ANY LOST PROFITS OR  LOST SAVINGS (WHETHER RESULTING FROM  IMPAIRED 
 OR LOST DATA, SOFTWARE OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR ANY OTHER CAUSE), EVEN IF IT  HAS 
 BEEN ADVISED  OF THE  POSSIBILITY OF  SUCH DAMAGES.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY  OTHER 
 PROVISION IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE LIABILITY OF LICENSOR FOR ANY REASON AND  UPON 
 ANY CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID TO LICENSOR BY LICENSEE 
 UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THIS  LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL  CAUSES OF ACTION IN  THE 
 AGGREGATE,  INCLUDING  (WITHOUT  LIMITATION)  BREACH  OF  CONTRACT,  BREACH  OF 
 WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE,  MISREPRESENTATIONS AND  OTHER TORTS.  THE PARTIES  AGREE 
 THAT THE REMEDIES AND LIMITATIONS HEREIN ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES 
 AS AUTHORIZED BY  APPLICABLE LAWS. THE  LICENSE FEES ARE  SET IN RELIANCE  UPON 
 THIS ALLOCATION OF RISK  AND THE EXCLUSION OF  CERTAIN DAMAGES AS SET  FORTH IN 
 THIS AGREEMENT. 
 
10.Authority.  Each party to this Agreement represents that the person executing 
 this Agreement on such party?s  behalf is authorized to execute  this Agreement 
 and upon execution this Agreement shall be a valid and binding agreement of the 
 parties enforceable in accordance with its terms. 
 
11.Miscellaneous.  
 
(a)Interpretation.  Failure by Licensor to exercise any right or remedy does not 
 signify acceptance of the event giving rise to such right or remedy. No  action 
 arising out of this License may be brought by Licensee more than one year after 
 the cause of action has accrued. If any part of this License is held by a court 
 of  competent jurisdiction  to be  illegal or  unenforceable, the  validity or 
 enforceability of the remainder of this License shall not be affected and  such 
 provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make such 
 provision  consistent  with applicable  law  and, in  its  modified form,  such 
 provision shall be enforceable and enforced. Licensor reserves the right not to 
 accept any Order Form. Any invoice  issued by Licensor in connection with  this 
 License  shall  be deemed  a  part of  this  Agreement. To  the  extent of  any 
 inconsistency between  an Order  Form and  an invoice  issued by  Licensor, the 
 terms and conditions of the invoice shall prevail; Licensee shall be deemed  to 
 have  accepted an  invoice upon  payment of  such invoice.  In the  event that 
 Licensee  placed  an  order  by  telephone  or  through  an  authorized   sales 
 representative, the invoice issued by Licensor shall constitute the Order Form. 
 The  terms  and conditions  of  this Agreement  shall  replace and  serve  as a 
 novation of the terms and conditions of any commercial license purchased online 
 by Licensee prior to January 2008. 
 
(b)Binding.  This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the 
 parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except, without the 
 prior written consent of Licensor, Licensee may not assign this License or  its 
 rights or obligations  under this License  to any person  or party, whether  by 
 operation of law or otherwise; any  attempt by Licensee to assign this  License 
 without Licensor's prior written consent shall  be null and void. There are  no 
 intended third party beneficiaries of this License. The parties are, and  shall 
 remain, independent contractors; nothing in this License is designed to create, 
 nor  shall  create  between  them, a  partnership,  joint  venture,  agency, or 
 employment relationship.  
 
(c)Governing Law;  Dispute Forum.   This License  shall be  deemed to  have been 
 executed in  Germany and  shall be  governed by  the laws  of Germany,  without 
 regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. In no event shall the United 
 Nations Convention on Contracts for  the International Sale of Goods  apply to, 
 or govern,  this License.  In the  event that  Licensee initiates  an action in 
 connection with  this License  or any  other dispute  between the  parties, the 
 exclusive  jurisdiction   of  such   action  shall   be  in   Munich,  Germany. 
 Notwithstanding the  foregoing, either  party may  bring a  counterclaim in  an 
 action in the same jurisdiction in  which the originating claim was filed,  and 
 either party may enforce  any judgment rendered by  such court in any  court of 
 competent  jurisdiction. Licensee  shall comply  at its  own expense  with all 
 relevant and applicable laws related to use and distribution of the Software as 
 permitted in  this License.  Notwithstanding the  foregoing, Licensor  may seek 
 injunctive or other  equitable relief in  any jurisdiction in  order to protect 
 its  intellectual property  rights. The  parties have  agreed to  execute this 
 License  in the  English language,  and the  English language  version of  the 
 Agreement will control for all purposes. Any action brought under this  License 
 shall  be  conducted in  the  English or  German  language. Licensee  shall  be 
 responsible for Licensor's  attorneys fees and  other expenses associated  with 
 the enforcement of this License or the collection of any amounts due under this 
 License. 
 
(d)Notice.  Unless  otherwise agreed,  any notice  under this  License shall  be 
 delivered and addressed to Licensee at the address set forth on the Order Form, 
 and to Licensor. Notice shall be deemed  received by any party: (a) on the  day 
 given, if personally delivered or if sent by confirmed facsimile  transmission, 
 receipt verified; (b) on the third  day after deposit, if mailed by  certified, 
 first class, postage prepaid, return  receipt requested mail, or by  reputable, 
 expedited overnight courier; or (c) on the fifth day after deposit, if sent  by 
 reputable, expedited international courier. Either party may change its address 
 for notice purposes upon notice  in accordance with this Section.  Licensor may 
 identify Licensee  as a  commercial licensee,  including on  the Licensor's web 
 site. 
 
(e)Entire Agreement.  This Agreement (including the Order Form and the  invoice) 
 comprises the entire agreement, and supercedes and merges all prior  proposals, 
 understandings and agreements, oral  and written, between the  parties relating 
 to  the  subject matter  of  this License.  This  Agreement may  be  amended or 
 modified only  in a  writing executed  by both  parties. To  the extent  of any 
 conflict  or  inconsistency  between  this License  and  any  invoice  or other 
 document  submitted  by  Licensee  to  Licensor,  this  License  will  control. 
 Licensor's acceptance of any document  shall not be construed as  an acceptance 
 of provisions  which are  in any  way in  conflict or  inconsistent with, or in 
 addition to, this  License, unless such  terms are separately  and specifically 
 accepted in writing by an authorized officer of Licensor.

2.5	Except as expressly stated in Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3,  Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor or Accellera under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in and to any Contribution not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

deposited by Contributor hereunder, including all Copyright Rights and patent rights embodied therein, shall be subject to the rights expressly granted in this Agreement including, without limitation, the licenses granted in Sections 2.1 and 2.3.

Copyright© 1996-[current year here] by all Contributors. All Rights reserved. The contents of this file are subject to the restrictions and limitations set forth in the SystemC Open Source License Version 3.1 (the License). You may not use this file except in compliance with such restrictions and limitations. You may obtain instructions on how to receive a copy of the License at http://www.accellera.org/. Software distributed by Contributors under the License is distributed exclusively on an AS IS basis, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. See the License for the specific language governing rights and limitations under the License.

3.2	Accellera may from time to time publish policies and procedures regarding the contribution or depositing of Contributions as well as establish additional details regarding the contribution process. Without limiting the foregoing, Accellera or the administrators of the Website shall have the right to remove any Contribution from the Website at any time.

4.	REQUIREMENTS OF DISTRIBUTION

4.1	A Recipient may choose to Distribute any Contribution or any compilation of multiple Contributions (except for any Code Contributions) under its own license agreement provided that:

(a)	Recipient complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;

(b)	As between Recipient and any other Contributor, Recipient assumes all warranties and conditions, express and implied, and all liability for damages arising out of its Distribution; and

(c)	Recipient makes available to recipients of such Distribution then Source Code for such Distributions, and informs them on how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
 


4.2	If a Recipient chooses to Distribute any Code Contribution or compilations of Code Contributions then:

(a)	Such Code Contribution must be Distributed under this Agreement; and

(b)	A copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of such Code Contribution.

4.3	Each Recipient must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Code Contribution so Distributed: Copyright© 1996-[current year here], by all Contributors. All rights reserved.

4.4	In addition, each Recipient that creates and Distributes or otherwise transfers a Modification whether or not such Modification has been deposited pursuant to Section 3 must identify the originator of such Modification in a manner that reasonably allows third parties to identify the originator of the Modification.

4.5	A Recipient may choose to Distribute the Accellera Documentation under its own license agreement, provided that Recipient complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Each Recipient must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Accellera Documentation so Distributed or transferred: Copyright© 1996-[current year here], by Accellera Systems Initiative. All rights reserved.

In addition, each Recipient that creates and Distributes a modification or Derivative work of the Accellera Documentation, whether or not such modification or Derivative work has been contributed pursuant to a Copyright Agreement must identify the originator of such modification or Derivative work in a manner that reasonably allows third parties to identify the originator of the modification or derivative work.

5.	INDEMNIFICATION

Any Recipient which Distributes any Contribution and/or Accellera Release (a Distributor) may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of Contributions Accellera Documentation and Accellera Releases, a Distributor shall Distribute such Contributions, Accellera Documentation and Accellera Releases in a manner which does not create potential liability for the Contributors. Therefore each Distributor hereby agrees to  defend  and  indemnify every Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Distributor, including but not limited to the terms and conditions under which Distributor offered such Contributions, Accellera Documentation and/or Accellera Releases in connection with its Distribution thereof. The obligations in this Section 5 do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement of any Contribution, Accellera Documentation or Accellera Release.  In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: (a) promptly notify the Distributor in writing of such claim, and (b) allow the Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in the defense of any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Recipient might include a Contribution in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Recipient is then a Distributor. If that Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties, support, or indemnity or any other license terms related to Product X, those performance claims, offers and other terms are such Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this Section 5, the Distributor would have to
 


defend claims against the Contributors related to those performance claims, offers, and other terms, and if a court requires any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Distributor must pay those damages.

6.	NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL CONTRIBUTIONS, ACCELLERA DOCUMENTATION AND ACCELLERA RELEASES ARE PROVIDED EXCLUSIVELY ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.	EACH RECIPIENT IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF ITS USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF ANY CONTRIBUTION, ACCELLERA DOCUMENTATION AND ACCELLERA RELEASE AND ASSUMES ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS EXERCISE OF RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE RISKS AND COSTS OF PROGRAM ERRORS, COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, DAMAGE TO OR LOSS OF DATA, PROGRAMS OR EQUIPMENT, AND UNAVAILABILITY OR INTERRUPTION OF OPERATIONS.   THIS DISCLAIMER OR WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT. NO USE OF ANY CONTRIBUTION, ACCELLERA DOCUMENTATION OR ACCELLERA RELEASE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

7.	DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF THE RECIPIENTS, CONTRIBUTORS OR ACCELLERA SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF ANY CONTRIBUTION, ACCELLERA DOCUMENTATION OR ACCELLERA RELEASE OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

8.	U.S. GOVERNMENT USE

If Recipient is licensing any computer program on behalf of any unit or agency of the United States Government, then such computer program is commercial computer software, and, pursuant to FAR 12.212 or DFARS 227.7202 and their successors, as applicable, shall be licensed to the Government under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

9.	PATENT CLAIMS

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim, counterclaim or declaratory judgment claim in a lawsuit) alleging that any Contribution, Accellera Release or combination of Contributions (excluding combinations of any Contribution with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then the rights granted to Recipient by each Contributor under Section 2 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

10.	TERMINATION

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if Recipient fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If such occurs, Recipient shall cease all use and Distribution of
 


any Contributions of any other Contributor, Accellera Documentation and Accellera Releases based upon the rights granted  to  Recipient  under this Agreement  as soon as reasonably practicable.

4) ./generic/regc_nfa.c - "One or two things that technically ought to be in here are actually in color.c, thanks to some incestuous relationships in the color chains."
6) ./generic/regguts.h - "Environmental customization. It should not (I hope) be necessary to alter the file you are now reading -- regcustom.h should handle it all, given care here and elsewhere."
8) ./generic/regfree.c - "You might think that this could be incorporated into regcomp.c, and that would be a reasonable idea... except that this is a generic function (with a generic name), applicable to all compiled Res regardless of the size of their characters, whereas the stuff in regcomp.c gets compiled once per character size."

This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in version 2.2 of Bison.  

C LALR(1) parser skeleton written by Richard Stallman, by simplifying the original so-called "semantic" parser.  

All symbols defined below should begin with yy or YY, to avoid infringing on user name space.  This should be done even for local variables, as they might otherwise be expanded by user macros. There are some unavoidable exceptions within include files to define necessary library symbols; they are noted "INFRINGES ON USER NAME SPACE" below.

Summary:
========

This directory contains the source code for U-Boot, a boot loader for
Embedded boards based on PowerPC, ARM, MIPS and several other
processors, which can be installed in a boot ROM and used to
initialize and test the hardware or to download and run application
code.

The development of U-Boot is closely related to Linux: some parts of
the source code originate in the Linux source tree, we have some
header files in common, and special provision has been made to
support booting of Linux images.

Some attention has been paid to make this software easily
configurable and extendable. For instance, all monitor commands are
implemented with the same call interface, so that it's very easy to
add new commands. Also, instead of permanently adding rarely used
code (for instance hardware test utilities) to the monitor, you can
load and run it dynamically.

Status:
=======

In general, all boards for which a configuration option exists in the
Makefile have been tested to some extent and can be considered
"working". In fact, many of them are used in production systems.

In case of problems see the CHANGELOG and CREDITS files to find out
who contributed the specific port. The MAINTAINERS file lists board
maintainers.

Where to get help:
==================

In case you have questions about, problems with or contributions for
U-Boot you should send a message to the U-Boot mailing list at
<u-boot@lists.denx.de>. There is also an archive of previous traffic
on the mailing list - please search the archive before asking FAQ's.
Please see http://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot and
http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.boot-loaders.u-boot

Where to get source code:
=========================

The U-Boot source code is maintained in the git repository at
git://www.denx.de/git/u-boot.git ; you can browse it online at
http://www.denx.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=u-boot.git;a=summary

The "snapshot" links on this page allow you to download tarballs of
any version you might be interested in. Official releases are also
available for FTP download from the ftp://ftp.denx.de/pub/u-boot/
directory.

Pre-built (and tested) images are available from
ftp://ftp.denx.de/pub/u-boot/images/

media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft 

..updates, 

..supplements, 

..Internet-based services, and 

..support services 

for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply. 

BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO 
NOT USE THE SOFTWARE. INSTEAD, RETURN IT TO THE RETAILER FOR A REFUND OR 
CREDIT. If you cannot obtain a refund there, contact Microsoft or the Microsoft affiliate serving your

United States and Canada, call (800) MICROSOFT or see www.microsoft.com/info/nareturns.htm. 

AS DESCRIBED BELOW, USING THE SOFTWARE ALSO OPERATES AS YOUR CONSENT TO THE 
TRANSMISSION OF CERTAIN COMPUTER INFORMATION DURING ACTIVATION, VALIDATION 
AND FOR INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. 

 ________________________________________________________________________________________ 

TRIAL USE RIGHTS and CONVERSION for Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2012 Trial 
Edition. If the software is a trial edition, then this Section applies to you. You may install and use any 
number of copies of the trial software on your devices. You may only use the trial software for internal 
evaluation purposes. 

You may convert your trial rights at any time to the full rights described in the rest of these license terms 
by purchasing a commercial license and obtaining a product key from Microsoft or one of its 
distributors. Your rights to use the trial software are limited to thirty (30) days but you may extend your 
use rights another sixty (60) days by registering the software. This will enable you to use the trial 
software for a total of ninety (90) days. During this time you may purchase a commercial license to 
continue using the software past the ninety (90) day trial period. After the expiration of the trial period, 
without conversion, the trial software will stop running. 

..Sections 14, 1116, 19, 23 and Limited Warranty do not apply. The remaining sections below 
apply. 

..DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED AS-IS. YOU BEAR 
THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, 
GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS 
UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE 
EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 


PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. 

..Because this software is as is, we may not provide support services for it. 

..LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER 
FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. 
YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST 
PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. 

This limitation applies to 

..anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet 
sites, or third party programs; and 

..claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, 
negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law. 

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. 
The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the 
exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages. 

When you acquire the retail license of the software named above, all of the license terms 
below apply. 

IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW FOR EACH 
LICENSE YOU ACQUIRE. 

1. OVERVIEW. 

a. Software. The software includes development tools, software programs and documentation. 

b. License Model. The software is licensed on a per user basis. 

2. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

stated in this agreement. 

b. Utilities. The software contains certain components that are identified in the Utilities List 
located at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=247624. Depending on the specific edition of the 
software, the number of Utility files you receive with the software may not be equal to the 
number of Utilities listed in the Utilities List. You may copy and install the Utilities you receive 
with the software on to other third party machines. These Utilities may only be used to debug 


and deploy your programs and databases you have developed with the software. You must 
delete all the Utilities installed onto a third party machine within the earlier of (i) when you have 
finished debugging or deploying your programs; or (ii) thirty (30) days after installation of the

e. Bing Maps. The software may include features that retrieve content such as maps, images and 
other data through the Bing Maps (or successor branded) application programming interface (the 
Bing Maps API) to create reports displaying data on top of maps, aerial and hybrid imagery. If 
these features are included, you may use these features to create and view dynamic or static 
documents only in conjunction with and through methods and means of access integrated in the 
software. You may not otherwise copy, store, archive, or create a database of the content 
available through the Bing Maps API. You may not use the Bing Maps API to provide sensor 
based guidance/routing, nor use any Road Traffic Data or Birds Eye Imagery (or associated 
metadata) even if available through the Bing Maps API for any purpose. Your use of the Bing 
Maps API and associated content is also subject to the additional terms and conditions at 
go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=21969.

________________________________________
LIMITED WARRANTY
A.	LIMITED WARRANTY. If you follow the instructions, the software will perform substantially as described in the Microsoft materials that you receive in or with the software. 

References to "limited warranty" are references to the express warranty provided by Microsoft. This warranty is given in addition to other rights and remedies you may have under law, including your rights and remedies in accordance with the statutory guarantees under local Consumer Law.
B.	TERM OF WARRANTY; WARRANTY RECIPIENT; LENGTH OF ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE LIMITED WARRANTY COVERS THE SOFTWARE FOR ONE YEAR AFTER ACQUIRED BY THE FIRST USER. IF YOU RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTS, UPDATES, OR REPLACEMENT SOFTWARE DURING THAT YEAR, THEY WILL BE COVERED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WARRANTY OR 30 DAYS, WHICHEVER IS LONGER. If the first user transfers the software, the remainder of the warranty will apply to the recipient. 

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS LAST ONLY DURING THE TERM OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY. Some states do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so these limitations may not apply to you. They also might not apply to you because some countries may not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty, guarantee or condition lasts.
C.	EXCLUSIONS FROM WARRANTY. This warranty does not cover problems caused by your acts (or failures to act), the acts of others, or events beyond Microsofts reasonable control.
D.	REMEDY FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY. MICROSOFT WILL REPAIR OR REPLACE THE SOFTWARE AT NO CHARGE. IF MICROSOFT CANNOT REPAIR OR REPLACE IT, MICROSOFT WILL REFUND THE AMOUNT SHOWN ON YOUR RECEIPT FOR THE SOFTWARE. IT WILL ALSO REPAIR OR REPLACE SUPPLEMENTS, UPDATES AND REPLACEMENT SOFTWARE AT NO CHARGE. IF MICROSOFT CANNOT REPAIR OR REPLACE THEM, IT WILL REFUND THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THEM, IF ANY. YOU MUST UNINSTALL THE SOFTWARE AND RETURN ANY MEDIA AND OTHER ASSOCIATED MATERIALS TO MICROSOFT WITH PROOF OF PURCHASE TO OBTAIN A REFUND.

Goods presented for repair may be replaced by refurbished goods of the same type rather than being replaced. Refurbished parts may be used to repair the goods.
H.	LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY. THE LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES CLAUSE ABOVE APPLIES TO BREACHES OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY.

________________________________________
These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. They apply to the software named above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services or updates for the software, except to the extent those have different terms.
________________________________________
IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.
1.	INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
a.	You may install and use any number of copies of the software.
b.	Backup copy. You may make one backup copy of the software, for reinstalling the software.
2.	TERMS FOR SPECIFIC COMPONENTS.
a.	Utilities. The software may contain some items on the Utilities List at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=523763&clcid=0x409. You may copy and install those items, if included with the software, on your machines or third party machines, to debug and deploy your applications and databases you develop with the software. Please note that Utilities are designed for temporary use, that Microsoft may not be able to patch or update Utilities separately from the rest of the software, and that some Utilities by their nature may make it possible for others to access machines on which they are installed. As a result, you should delete all Utilities you have installed after you finish debugging or deploying your applications and databases. Microsoft is not responsible for any third party use or access of Utilities you install on any machine.
b.	Microsoft Platforms. The software may include components from Microsoft Windows; Microsoft Windows Server; Microsoft SQL Server; Microsoft Exchange; Microsoft Office; and Microsoft SharePoint. These components are governed by separate agreements and their own product support policies, as described in the license terms found in the installation directory for that component or in the Licenses folder accompanying the software.
c.	Third Party Components. The software may include third party components with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the ThirdPartyNotices file accompanying the software. Even if such components are governed by other agreements, the disclaimers and the limitations on and exclusions of damages below also apply.
3.	DATA. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the product documentation. There are also some features in the software that may enable you to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features to enable data collection in your applications, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and the privacy statement at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=528096&clcid=0x409. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.
4.	SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights.

In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
	work around any technical limitations in the software;
	reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;
	remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;

	share, publish or lend the software, or provide the software as a stand-alone hosted as solution for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.

You must comply with all applicable international and national laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions programs, and end-user, end use and destination restrictions by the U.S. and other governments related to Microsoft products, services and technologies.

8.	APPLICABLE LAW. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.
9.	LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your state or country. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your state or country if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. Without limitation of the foregoing, for Australia, YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS.
10.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED AS-IS. YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
11.	LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

 * TODO:
 * - Support for interfaces other than Ethernet (SLIP, PPP, ...)
 *
 * Please coordinate changes and requests with Leon Woestenberg

 *
 * Integration with your code:
 *
 * In lwip/dhcp.h
 * #define DHCP_COARSE_TIMER_SECS (recommended 60 which is a minute)
 * #define DHCP_FINE_TIMER_MSECS (recommended 500 which equals TCP coarse timer)
 *
 * Then have your application call dhcp_coarse_tmr() and
 * dhcp_fine_tmr() on the defined intervals.
 *
 * dhcp_start(struct netif *netif);
 * starts a DHCP client instance which configures the interface by
 * obtaining an IP address lease and maintaining it.
 *
 * Use dhcp_release(netif) to end the lease and use dhcp_stop(netif)
 * to remove the DHCP client.

       will provide support for the altered versions.

    4. Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP," "Zip," "UnZip,"

support on both zip and unzip Copyright (C) 2009-2010 Mathias Svensson (
http://result42.com ) For more info read MiniZip_info.txt Decryption code comes
from crypt.c by Info-ZIP but has been greatly reduced in terms of compatibility
with older software. The following is from the original crypt.c. Code woven in
by Terry Thorsen 1/2003. Copyright (c) 1990-2000 Info-ZIP. All rights reserved.

.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/license.html crypt.c (full version) by Info-ZIP. Last
revised: [see crypt.h] The encryption/decryption parts of this source code (as
opposed to the non-echoing password parts) were originally written in Europe.
The whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.
(Prior to January 2000, re-export from the US was a violation of US law.) This
encryption code is a direct transcription of the algorithm from Roger Schlafly,
described by Phil Katz in the file appnote.txt. This file (appnote.txt) is
distributed with the PKZIP program (even in the version without encryption
capabilities). Changes in unzip.c 2007-2008 - Even Rouault - Addition of
cpl_unzGetCurrentFileZStreamPos 2007-2008 - Even Rouault - Decoration of symbol
names unz -> cpl_unz 2007-2008 - Even Rouault - Remove old C style function
prototypes 2007-2008 - Even Rouault - Add unzip support for ZIP64 Copyright (C)
2007-2008 Even Rouault Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Removed cpl_ from symbol
names (Even Rouault added them but since this is now moved to a new project
(minizip64) I renamed them again). Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Fixed problem
if uncompressed size was > 4G and compressed size was <4G should only read the
compressed/uncompressed size from the Zip64 format if the size from normal
header was 0xFFFFFFFF Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Applied some bug fixes from
paches recived from Gilles Vollant Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Applied support
to unzip files with compression mathod BZIP2 (bzip2 lib is required) Patch
created by Daniel Borca Jan-2010 - back to unzip and minizip 1.0 name scheme,
with compatibility layer Copyright (C) 1998 - 2010 Gilles Vollant, Even Rouault,

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

License Grant

Subject to the Terms and Conditions of this AGREEMENT, CODALOGIC LTD hereby grants YOU a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual right to use THE SOFTWARE. 

YOU may reproduce, install and use THE SOFTWARE in accordance with the following Conditions: 

(i) THE SOFTWARE may be used in EVALUATION MODE without a LICENSE FILE.

(ii) THE SOFTWARE can be used in EVALUATION MODE only for the purpose of determining whether THE SOFTWARE is fit for purpose.

(iii) THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT that is ultimately intended to be supplied to a THIRD PARTY (or many thereof) must be generated by a copy of THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM for which a PERPETUAL LICENSE FILE has been acquired directly or indirectly from CODALOGIC LTD.

(iv) THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT that is used to directly or indirectly develop code ultimately intended to be supplied to a THIRD PARTY (or many thereof) must be generated by a copy of THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM for which a PERPETUAL LICENSE FILE has been acquired directly or indirectly from CODALOGIC LTD.

(v) Other than for evaluation purposes and for use by students on a training course recognised by CODALOGIC LTD, a unique PERPETUAL LICENSE FILE is required for each USER of THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM. A single LICENSE FILE must not be used by more than one USER.

(vi) A unique PERPETUAL LICENSE FILE is required for each machine that autonomously runs THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM (such as a nightly build machine).

(vi) Without prior arrangement with CODALOGIC LTD, A LICENSE FILE may be transferred to another USER up to 4 times in any 12 month period. On transferring a LICENSE FILE to a another USER the previous USER must delete all copies of THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM, THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE and any configuration files from any machine that the transferred LICENSE FILE has been associated with. (Informational note: If a LICENSE FILE that was initially assigned to USER A, is transferred to USER B and then later transferred back to USER A, that is considered to be two transfers of the LICENSE FILE.)

(viii) A LICENSE FILE must not be sublicensed, leased, rented, loaned, lent, sold, time-shared, or otherwise transferred for value to any other party.

(ix) Subject to Condition (xi), YOU may directly or indirectly supply as a component part of a larger software item THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT that has been generated by a copy of THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM for which a PERPETUAL LICENSE FILE has been acquired directly or indirectly from CODALOGIC LTD to a THIRD PARTY (or many thereof).

(x) Subject to Condition (xi), YOU may directly or indirectly supply THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE to a THIRD PARTY (or many thereof) only in combination with THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT generated by a copy of THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM for which a PERPETUAL LICENSE FILE has been acquired directly or indirectly from CODALOGIC LTD.

(xi) Without prior arrangement with CODALOGIC LTD, YOU or any USER or any INTEGRATOR may not directly or indirectly supply THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT or THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE to a THIRD PARTY in a form that the THIRD PARTY could compile, link, or by some other process incorporate THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT or THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE into other software items. (Informational note: Subject to the Conditions specified herein, THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT and THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE may be supplied to a THIRD PARTY in the form of one or more Windows DLL or Linux .so files as long as the corresponding C++ header file - for example the C++ .h file - is NOT supplied to the THIRD PARTY. This is because CODALOGIC LTD takes the position that without the corresponding C++ header file a Windows DLL or Linux .so file is not in a form that it can be incorporated into other software items.)

(xii) At the discretion of CODALOGIC LTD, a free, time-limited LICENSE FILE may be provided to a USER for the purpose of extended evaluation. THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT associated with such a free, time-limited LICENSE FILE may not be supplied in any form (e.g. compiled or otherwise) to a THIRD PARTY. The possession of such a free, time-limited LICENSE FILE does not confer any rights to distribute THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE to a THIRD PARTY. 

(xiii) At the discretion of CODALOGIC LTD, a free LICENSE FILE may be provided to a USER who is a member of an academic institution. THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT and THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE associated with such a free LICENSE FILE may be supplied to an ACADEMIC FUNDING PARTY only for non-commercial training purposes.

(xiv) At the discretion of CODALOGIC LTD, a free LICENSE FILE may be provided to a training provider recognised by CODALOGIC LTD for the temporary use of students attending a training course recognised by CODALOGIC LTD. THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT and THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE associated with such a free LICENSE FILE may be supplied to an ACADEMIC FUNDING PARTY only for non-commercial training purposes. 

Any use of THE SOFTWARE not explicitly permitted by the above Conditions is expressly not permitted, unless separate written agreement has been obtained from CODALOGIC LTD.

A USER may use THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM on any number of machines subject to said machines being solely for the use of said USER.

An INTEGRATOR may use THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT and THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE without acquiring a LICENSE FILE.

Subject to the above Conditions, THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT and THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE may be supplied to a THIRD PARTY (or many thereof) royalty-free.

A USER may modify THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE, but this does not change any restrictions imposed on the allowed uses of THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE.

THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM is licensed as a single product. Except as otherwise stated, its component parts may not be separated for use by more than one USER. 

YOU or any USER must not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble THE SOFTWARE, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law. 
Copyright

THE SOFTWARE and its documentation are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. CODALOGIC LTD owns the title, copyright, and other intellectual property rights in THE SOFTWARE, and its documentation. CODALOGIC LTD reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this agreement. THE SOFTWARE is licensed, not sold.
Right to Refund

If YOU decide that THE SOFTWARE is not suitable for your purpose YOU are entitled to a refund of the amount you paid for the first LICENSE FILE, at any time prior to YOU delivering any item that depends on THE SOFTWARE to a THIRD PARTY or within a period of 90 days from the date of order, whichever is the earlier. On determining that THE SOFTWARE is not suitable for your purpose, all copies of THE SOFTWARE associated with a LICENSE FILE for which a refund is being claimed must be destroyed.
Termination

Without prejudice to any other rights, CODALOGIC LTD may terminate this AGREEMENT if YOU fail to comply with the Terms and Conditions of this AGREEMENT. In such event, YOU and any USER and any INTEGRATOR must destroy all copies of THE SOFTWARE in your possession.
Disclaimer

This AGREEMENT is governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with, English law. The courts of England shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any cost, action or proceedings, and to settle any disputes that may arise out of or in connection with this AGREEMENT and YOU irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such courts.

3. Distribution Obligations
3.1. Application of License
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.

The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

3.3. Description of Modifications
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
    (a) Third Party Claims
    If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. 
    (b) Contributor APIs
    If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 
    (c) Representations
    Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. 

3.5. Required Notices
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2.

The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.

If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.7. Larger Works
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Trademark Usage
5.1. Advertising Materials

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

8. TERMINATION

8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:
    (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. 
    (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1 (b) and 2.2 (b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. 

8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS
The Covered Code is a "commercial item", as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation", as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This license shall be governed by the Laws of Austria. Disputes shall be settled by an Austrian Court. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.

Common Public License 1.0
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
Common Public License (CPL) -- V1.0

03 May 2005
Updated 16 Apr 2009

As of 25 Feb 2009, IBM has assigned the Agreement Steward role for the CPL to the Eclipse Foundation. Eclipse has designated the Eclipse Public License (EPL) as the follow-on version of the CPL.

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1.	DEFINITIONS 

"Contribution" means:

a. in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
b. in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i. changes to the Program, and
ii. additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2.	GRANT OF RIGHTS 

a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3.	REQUIREMENTS 
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b. its license agreement:

i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv. states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a. it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b. a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4.	COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 

5.	NO WARRANTY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6.	DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

GENERAL 
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous

royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party
intellectual property claims:

          (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions
thereof) with or without Modifications, or as part of a
Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or
controlled by Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and
sell ("Utilize") the Original Code (or portions thereof),
but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably
necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original Code (or
portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be
necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

     2.2. Contributor Grant.
     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party
intellectual property claims:

          (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such
Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified
basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part
of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or
controlled by Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor
Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that
any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to
Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and
not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize
further Modifications or combinations.

3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You
contribute are governed by the terms of this License,
including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code
version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the
terms of this License or a future version of this License
released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of
this License with every copy of the Source Code You
distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.
However, You may include an additional document offering the
additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You
contribute must be made available in Source Code form under
the terms of this License via an accepted Electronic
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
Executable version available and to the Initial Developer;
and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after
the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
months after a subsequent version of that particular
Modification has been made available to such recipients. You
are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You are
responsible for notifying the Initial Developer of the
Modification and the location of the Source if a contact
means is provided. Cygnus will be acting as maintainer of
the Source and may provide an Electronic Distribution
mechanism for the Modification to be made available. You can
contact Cygnus to make the Modification available and to
notify the Initial Developer. (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos)

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute
to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create
that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must
include a prominent statement that the Modification is
derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided
by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any
notice in an Executable version or related documentation in
which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered
Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If You have knowledge that a party claims an
intellectual property right in particular functionality or
code (or its utilization under this License), you must
include a text file with the source code distribution titled
"LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the
claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You
shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make
available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as
notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Your Modification is an application programming
interface and You own or control patents which are
reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also
include this information in the LEGAL file.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation
for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights
relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more
Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to
the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in
a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you
must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
directory file) where a user would be likely to look for
such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations
to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
     However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not
on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only
if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for
that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that
the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
under the terms of this License, including a description of
how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section
3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice
in an Executable version, related documentation or
collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating
to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice,
which may contain terms different from this License,
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
License and that the license for the Executable version does
not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the
Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a
different license You must make it absolutely clear that any
terms which differ from this License are offered by You
alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
You offer.
     If you distribute executable versions containing
Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in
the documentation and/or other materials provided with the
product.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code
with other code not governed by the terms of this License
and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.

     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the
terms of this License with respect to some or all of the
Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a)
comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
possible; (b) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits
you from adhering to the license; and (c) describe the
limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and
must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. You
must submit this LEGAL file to Cygnus for review, and You
will not be able use the covered code in any means until
permission is granted from Cygnus to allow for the inability
to comply due to statute or regulation.

5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.

     This License applies to code to which the Initial
Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to
related Covered Code.
      Cygnus may include Covered Code in products without
such additional products becoming subject to the terms of
this License, and may license such additional products on
different terms from those contained in this License.
     Cygnus may license the Source Code of Cygnus's Branded
Code without Cygnus's Branded Code becoming subject to the
terms of this License, and may license Cygnus's Branded Code
on different terms from those contained in this License.
Contact Cygnus for details of alternate licensing terms
available.

6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.

     6.1. New Versions.
     Cygnus may publish revised and/or new versions of the
License from time to time. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular
version of the License, You may always continue to use it
under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use
such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version
of the License published by Cygnus. No one other than Cygnus
has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
beyond what is granted under this and subsequent Licenses.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If you create or use a modified version of this License
(which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is
not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must
(a) rename Your license so that the phrases "ECOS", "eCos",
"Cygnus", "CPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not
appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it
clear that your version of the license contains terms which
differ from the eCos Public License and Cygnus Public
License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS
IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT
THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU
(NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME
THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered
Code which are properly granted shall survive any
termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
License shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,
SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH
PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF
ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR
LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY
NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term
is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
"commercial computer software" and "commercial computer
software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212
and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only
those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

     This License represents the complete agreement
concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. This License shall be governed by California
law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law
provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered
to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless
otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this
License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual
property rights) shall be subject to final and binding
arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of
arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement
shall be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the
auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating
to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California,
with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the
losing party responsible for costs, including without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against
the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

     Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to
comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages
arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of
rights under this License, based on the number of copies of
Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received
from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You
agree to work with affected parties to distribute
responsibility on an equitable basis.

13. ADDITIONAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO THE CYGNUS ECOS PUBLIC
LICENSE.

      Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to
prohibit Cygnus from licensing under different terms than
this License any code which Cygnus otherwise would have a
right to license.

      Cygnus and logo - This License does not grant any
rights to use the trademark Cygnus, the Cygnus logo,
eCos logo, even if such marks are included in the Original
Code. You may contact Cygnus for permission to display the

Executable version beyond that required in Exhibit B.

     Inability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation - To
the extent that Cygnus is limited contractually from making
third party code available under this License, Cygnus may
choose to integrate such third party code into Covered Code

in Source Code form, even if such third party code would
otherwise be considered "Modifications" under this License.

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.















GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.















GNU Free Documentation License, version 1.1
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
                GNU Free Documentation License
                   Version 1.1, March 2000

 Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.











GNU General Public License, version 2
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.





















GNU General Public License, version 3
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.






















GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library General Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.




















GNU Library General Public License, version 2
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

     Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Library General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
    Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston,
    MA 02111-1307, USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

    in the case of <ORGANIZATION:> ("<OWNER>"), the Original Program, and
    in the case of each Contributor,
        changes to the Program, and
        additions to the Program; 
    where such changes and/or additions to the Program were added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf, and the Contributor explicitly consents, in accordance with Section 3C, to characterization of the changes and/or additions as Contributions. 

"Contributor" means <OWNER> and any other entity that has Contributed a Contribution to the Program.

"Distributor" means a Recipient that distributes the Program, modifications to the Program, or any part thereof.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Original Program" means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by <OWNER>, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.

"Program" means the Original Program and Contributions or any part thereof

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall also apply to the combination of the Contribution of that Contributor and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not apply to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to (ii) Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A. Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under this Agreement or under its own license agreement, provided that:

    it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
    if the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible form, a copy of this Agreement or Distributor's own license agreement is included with each copy of the Program; and
    if distributed under Distributor's own license agreement, such license agreement:
        effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
        effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; and
        states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party. 

    B. Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:

    Copyright (C) <YEAR>, <ORGANIZATION> and others. All Rights Reserved.

    C. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. Also, each Contributor must agree that the additions and/or changes are intended to be a Contribution. Once a Contribution is contributed, it may not thereafter be revoked.

    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore, if a Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Distributor ("Commercial Distributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

    For example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If that Commercial Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor must pay those damages.

    5. NO WARRANTY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    7. EXPORT CONTROL

    Recipient agrees that Recipient alone is responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries).

    8. GENERAL

    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

    LUCENT may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than LUCENT has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, The Open Group Agreement and this Section 2, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. 
 
c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. 
 
d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 
 
3. REQUIREMENTS 

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: 

a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and The Open Group Agreement; and  

b. its license agreement:  

1. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:  

a)       promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and  

b)       allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.  

The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. 

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 

5. NO WARRANTY 

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

7. GENERAL 

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.  

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.  

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.  

METRO LINK may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number.

          Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
          Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
          Version (or portions of such combination).

          (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
          effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
          the Covered Code.

          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
          granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
          Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
          3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
          Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
          by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
          that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
     Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.

               (c)    Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
          this License.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
     terms You offer.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
     understand it.

5. Application of this License.

     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
     will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
     Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
     this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
     shall survive.

     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
     the 60 day notice period specified above.

     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
     Participant.

     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
     license.

     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
     prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
     rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
     License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

Python Software Foundation License Version 2
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.
