 * should fill out the fields of this data structure as follows:
 * chan_load:
 * Compute a load factor for the new session.  Channel load should
 * be a value of between 1-1000 (with 1000 representing a maximal
 * value indicating that the current kernel is loaded 100%).  Compare
 * the computed load factor with the curr_kern_load value passed
 * into the callback.  If the curr_kern_load + your newly computed
 * load factor > 1000, then the channel request should be rejected
 * and channel id should = -1;
 * chan_id:
 * If a channel is allocated, fill the chan_id property with the
 * assigned channel number.
 * Example:
 * Accept a new session as channel 3 utilzing approximately 45.7% of the kernel.
 * new_channel->chan_id = 3
 * new_channel->chan_load = 457
 *
 * Note: in all cases wherein a channel request is rejected, the alloc_chan
 * implementation should return an error code status.
