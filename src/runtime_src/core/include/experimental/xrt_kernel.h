 * class runlist - A class to manage a list of xrt::run objects
 *
 * @brief
 * This class is used to manage a list of xrt::run objects such
 * that they can be executed atomically in the order they are added
 * to the list.
 *
 * @details
 * Run objects are added to the list using the add() method. A runlist
 * is submitted for execution using the execute() method. Once the
 * list is executing, no more run objects can be added until execution
 * of the current last run object has completed. The list can be reset
 * using the reset() method, which will clear all run objects, or the
 * list can be reused by calling execute() again maybe with additional
 * run objects.
 *
 * There is no support for removing individual run objects from the
 * list.
