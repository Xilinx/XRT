 * @details The ip can be controlled through read- and write register
 * only.  If the IP supports interrupt notification, then xrt::ip
 * objects supports enabling and control of underlying IP interrupt.
 *
 * In order to construct an ip object, the following requirements must be met:
 *
 *   - The custom IP must appear in IP_LAYOUT section of xclbin.
 *   - The custom IP must have a base address such that it can be controlled
 *     through register access at offsets from base address.
 *   - The custom IP must have an address range so that write and read access
 *     to base address offset can be validated.
 *   - XRT supports exclusive access only for the custom IP, this is to other
 *     processes from accessing the same IP at the same time.
