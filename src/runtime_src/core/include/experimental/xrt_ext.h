 *
 * @brief Buffer object extension
 * xrt::ext::bo is an extension of xrt::bo with additional functionality
 *
 * @details
 * An extension buffer amends the contruction of an xrt::bo with
 * additional simplified constructors for specifying access mode of
 * host only buffers.
 *
 * Once constructed, the object must be assigned to an xrt::bo object
 * before use.  This is becayse XRT relies on templated kernel
 * argument assignment and the templated assignment operator is not
 * specialized for xrt::ext::bo.
 *
 * Ultimately the extension will be merged into class xrt::bo.

   * @enum access_mode - buffer object accessibility
   *
   * @var none
   *   No access is specified, same as read|write|local
   * @var read
   *   The buffer is read by device, the cpu writes to the buffer
   * @var write
   *   The buffer is written by device, the host reads from the buffer
   * @var local
   *   Access is local to process and device on which it is allocated
   * @var shared
   *   Access is shared between devices within process
   * @var process
   *   Access is shared between processes and devices
   * @var hybrid
   *   Access is shared between drivers (cross-adapter)
   *
   * The access mode is used to specify how the buffer is used by
   * device and process.
   *
   * A buffer can be specified as local, meaning it is only used by
   * the process and device on which it is allocated.  A buffer can
   * also be specified as shared, meaning it is shared between devices
   * within the process.  Finally a buffer can be specified as
   * process, meaning it is shared between processes and devices. If
   * neither local, shared, or process is specified, the default is
   * local.  Only one of local, shared, or process can be specified.
   *
   * A buffer can be opened for read, meaning the device will read the
   * content written by host, or it can be opened for write, meaning
   * the device will write to the buffer and the host will read. To
   * specify that a buffer is used for both read and write, the access
   * flags can be ORed.  If neither read or write is specified, the
   * default is read|write.
   *
   * The default access mode is read|write|local when no access mode
   * is specified.
   *
   * Friend operators are provided for bitwise operations on access
   * mode.  It is invalid to combine local, shared, proces, and hybrid.
