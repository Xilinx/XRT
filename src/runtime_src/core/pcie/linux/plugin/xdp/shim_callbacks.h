// This file contains the callbacks to the various XDP plugins that deal
// with retrieving data from the device, which need to be called from
// the shim at various times.  Since all of the plugins are independent and
// may or may not be loaded in different executions, we must call each plugins
// function sequentially.  The functions themselves will simply return if
// the plugin was not loaded, so there is minimal overhead when profiling
// is turned off.
