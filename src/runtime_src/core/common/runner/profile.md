# Execution profile for XRT runner

An execution profile is an extension to a run recipe (see
[recipe](recipe.md)).  It automates the run recipe by binding
resources to the XRT runner that executes the run recipe.

While the `xrt::runner` class can be used stand-alone by an
application or framework that explicitly manages external resources,
the execution recipe extends the runner to also manage the external
resources.

An execution profile is useful for testing of a run recipe.  It allows
for one external application controlling execution of a run recipe by
defininng:

- how data is bound to resources
- how validation is performed
- how many times a run-recipe is executed and with what data

# JSON format

There are two sections of profile json:

1. [qos](#qos)
2. [bindings](#bindings)
3. [execution](#execution)

The `bindings` section defines how external resources are created,
initialized, and bound to a run-recipe.

The `execution` section controls how the run-recipe is executed and
how many times along with what should be done in each iteration.

## QoS

Simple key/value pairs designating configuration parameters for
hardware context creation. 
```
  "qos": {
    "gops": 10,
    "fps": 30
  },
```
The json schema doesn't enforce key names or value ranges, XRT will
warn but ignore unrecoqnized keys. Improper values are implementation 
defined.

## Bindings

The bindings section specifies how external buffers should be created,
initialized, and validated. The section is an array of binding elements,
where each binding element must reference a resource in the run-recipe.

A binding element references a the name of the resource buffer to bind
to the recipe along with various attributes.  The xrt::runner will create an
`xrt::bo` for each specified binding element.  The size of the buffer
is optional optional when the buffer is
initialized from a file, but is otherwise required.
```
  "bindings": [
    { 
      "name": "wts",
      "bind": bool,
      "size": bytes
    },
    { ... }
  ],
```
A binding elememnt has some simple attributes and more complex
nested attributes

### Simple attributes of a binding element
The simple attributes are json key-value pairs:
```
    { 
      "name": "wts",     // name of a resource buffer
      "bind": bool,
      "size": bytes
    },
```

- `bind` indicates if the buffer should be re-bound to the run
recipe in each iteration of the recipe (more about this in the
execution section).  All buffers are by default bound to the 
recipe upon creation.
- `size` (optional with file initialization) specifies the size
of the `xrt::bo` created and bound to the recipe.

### Nested elements of a binding element
The binding element support the following optional nested elements:
```
      "init": { ... }
      "validate": { ... }
```

- `init` (optional) specifies how the `xrt::bo` created by the runner
should be initialized. There are multiple ways to initialize a buffer.
- `validate` (optional) specifies if the buffer content should be 
 validated and how after an execution of the recipe.
 
### Initialization of a resource buffer

The bindings element results in the creation of the `xrt::bo` buffer
object.  Upon creation, the buffer object is initialzied per the init
sub-element.  There are several ways to initialize a buffer only one
of which can be specified.

#### Random initialization

```
      "init": {
        "random": true // random initialization of the full buffer
      }
```

Random initialization is using a `std::random_device` along with
`rd()` to create a pseudo random value for each byte of the buffer.
If random initialization is used, the `size` of the buffer must also
have been specified.


#### File initialization

```

      "init": {
        "file": "<path or repo key>",
        "skip": bytes // skip number of bytes in file
      }
```

File initialization implies that the resource buffer should be
intialized with the content of the `file`.  The `file` must reference
a key that locates a file on disk or in an artifacts repository used
during construction of the `xrt::runner`.  If the binding element
specifies a `size` value, then this size takes precendence over the
size of the file, otherwise the size of the file will be the size of
the buffer. The data copied into the buffer is the minimum of the
specified size or the size of the file.  The optional `skip` element
allows skipping first bytes of the file during initialization of the
buffer.

#### Strided initialization

```
      "init": {
        "stride": 1,    // stide bytes
        "value": 239,   // value to write at each stride
        "begin": 0,     // begining of range to write at
        "end": 524288   // end of range
      }
```
A buffer can
also be initialized with a fixed pattern at every `stride` byte.  This 
is referred to as strided buffer initialization.

In the above example, the buffer range specified by `begin` and `end`
is written with the byte value `239` at every byte (`stride` is
1). The value can be any uint64_t value, but must be a decimal value
in order to be valid json.  To initalize a buffer with with
0xdeadbeef, convert to decimal and write:

```
      "init": {
        "stride": 4,
        "value": 3735928559
      }
```

#### Validation

After executon, a buffer can be validated against golden data. This is
specifed using a `validate` element for the binding.

```
    {
      "validate": {
        "file": "ofm.bin"
      }
    }
```

Validating can be against the content of a file as shown in above
example, or it can be against another resource from the run recipe, in
which case the validation element must contain a name reference
instead of a file:

```
      "validate": {
        "name": "ifm"
      }
```

The validate element will be enhanced to cover other validation
specifics as needed.

## Execution

The execution section of a profile specifies how many times the recipe
should be executed and how.  It controls what should happen after each
iteration and before next iteration.

```
  "execution" : {
    "iterations": 500,
    "iteration" : {
      "bind": false,
      "init": true,
      "wait": true,
      "sleep": 1000,
      "validate": true
    }
  }
```

The iteration element specifies what should happen before after each
iteration of the run recipe.

- `bind` indicates if buffers should be re-bound to the
recipe before an iteration.  Only buffers whos binding element
specifies `bind` are re-bound.  All buffers are by default
bound to the recipe upon creation.
- `init` indicates if buffer should be initialized per what is
specified in the binding element.
- `wait` says that execution should wait for completion between
iterations and after last iteration.
- `sleep` specifies how many milliseconds to sleep in between iterations
of the recipe.  If both `wait` and `sleep` are specified, sleep will
be applied after wait completes.
iterations and after last iteration.
- `validate` means buffer validation per what is specified in
the binding element.

# Instatiating an xrt::runner with a profile

An execution profile is useless without a run recipe.  But a run
recipe can have several execution profiles, and less likely a
profile could be used with multiple recipes.

The profile (and the recipe) may reference file artifacts. These
artifacts can be passed to the runner in two different ways. (1) the
runner can be instantied with a path to a directory containing the
referenced artifacts (files), or (2) it can be instantiated with an
artifacts repository that have all the artifacts in memory pre-loaded.

See [runner.h](runner.h) or details.
