# Runner instrastructure

This directory contains xrt::runner infrastructure. The runner is
broken into two json components.  First is the recipe that defines a
model executed by the xrt::runner.  Second is the profile that defines
under what constraints how the model is executed.

- [recipe](recipe.md)
- [profile](profile.md)
