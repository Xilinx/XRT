        This cmdline tool is mainly used to flash sc on U30.
        U30 card has 2 FPGAs in one card. Each FPGA has one cmc running

        can be used to flash the sc. Please run 'xbmgmt flash --scan' to

        #      and hence get FPGA pair on same card before flashing. In this case,
        #      we just don't try to kill processes running on the buddy FPGA. This
        #      should be fine
        #2. call 'xbmgmt flash' on the specified FPGA
        #3. call 'xbmgmt reset --ert' on the 'fixed sc' FPGA to reboot cmc
        #   this step 3 is a workaround to https://jira.xilinx.com/browse/CR-1076187

        #      (new) card reset solution rely on a working SC to report S/N info, so
