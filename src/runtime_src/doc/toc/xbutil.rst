The Xilinx® Board Utility (xbutil) is a standalone command line utility that is included with the
XRT installation package. The ``xbutil`` command supports both Alveo Data Center accelerator cards 
and embedded processor-based platforms. It includes multiple commands to validate and identify 
the installed accelerator card(s) along with additional card details including DDR, PCIe®, target 
platform name, and system information. This information can be used for both card administration 
and application debugging.
