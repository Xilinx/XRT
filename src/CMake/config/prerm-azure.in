# UBUNTU NOTE
# -----------
# 1. When downgrading (say from 2.3.0 to 2.2.0) then prerm of 2.3.0 is run
#    but postinst of 2.2.0 is run. The prerm is invoked with "upgrade 2.2.0"
#    argument and postinst is invoked with "configure 2.3.0" argument.
# 2. When upgrading (say from 2.2.0 to 2.3.0) then prerm of 2.2.0 is run
#    but postinst of 2.3.0 is run. The prerm is invoked with "upgrade 2.3.0"
#    argument and postinst is invoked with "configure 2.2.0" argument.
# 3. When re-installing (say from 2.2.0 to 2.2.0) then prerm of 2.2.0 is run
#    and postinst of 2.2.0 is run. The prerm is invoked with "upgrade 2.2.0"
#    argument and postinst is invoked with "configure 2.2.0" argument.
#
# RHEL/CentOS NOTE
# ----------------
# 1. When downgrading (say from 2.3.0 to 2.2.0) then oddly postinst of 2.2.0
#    is run first followed by prerm of 2.3.0 run. The postinst is invoked with
#    "2" and prerm is invoked with "1".
# 2. When upgrading (say from 2.2.0 to 2.3.0) then prerm of 2.2.0 is NOT run
#    but postinst of 2.3.0 is run. The postinst is invoked with "2" argument.
# 3. When re-installing (say from 2.2.0 to 2.2.0) then prerm is NOT run but
#    and postinst of 2.2.0 is run. The postinst is invoked with "2" argument.

# In the case of upgrade, downgrade or re-install we would like to preserve the
# configuration of the components and hence we want to handle the configuration
# in postinst script.
