Setup required in Host and Guest.

Host Setup:
* make to build mpd and msd
* scp mpd to guest
* create files host_ip and host_port and place them in a location, such as /var/lib/libvirt/filesystem_passthrough/
* with guest loaded and userpf controlled by guest, configure sw mailbox:
* from sudo shell: echo 256 > config_mailbox_channel_switch # to pass xclbins through sw mailbox
* as sudo, run msd

Guest Setup:
* map filesystem passthrough by running setup_mpd.sh:
   #!/bin/bash
   sudo mkdir /tmp/host_files
   sudo mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L /hostshare /tmp/host_files
**NOTE** '/hostshare' might be part of the virt-manager configuration on the guest
* rmmod xocl
* modprobe xclmgmt
* as sudo, run mpd
* 'xbutil program -p verify.xclbin', and confirm that it succeeds
