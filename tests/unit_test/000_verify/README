** Hello World - OpenCL Example 1 **

- Chris Baronne

Description:

This is an extremely simple OpenCL Kernel and accompanying host code to verify at
a minimum that the OpenCL platform has basic functionality.  It will make a call
to the kernel with an empty global buffer.  The kernel will then write the string
of characters "Hello World\n\0" into the buffer and return.  The host will copy
this buffer locally and then print out the resulting buffer contents.

Example Output:

<OpenCL Setup>

RESULT:
Hello World
